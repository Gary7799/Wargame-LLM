(08:27) room he's got some time to adjust but if you let Maru go up too many maps in a row it's going to feel overwhelming game two Starts Now with Maru versus Oliveira right now Morrow up with a one to zero lead in the upper left in the red he is Maru and in the bottom right in the blue he he Oliveira so we are now on graspon let's see what these openers are going to be it looks like Maru does want to do a double Barracks proxy opener so he is sending out two early SUVs going to make a couple Barracks is this going to be
(09:21) Reaper I mean we have seen some craziness like proxy Marauder builds from from hero Marine but I bet you this will just be a lot of Reaper pressure could be um we did see the Observer hinting to us that maybe he could land it up there like a liftoff I don't know if that's going to be the case uh we do want to talk about the fact that Morrow has this long history of proxine more than um at times in Starcraft 2's history more than all the other terrans there were I think the year that he actually won like
(09:49) several gsls in a row was mostly off the back of proxies yes um another indicator of of uh you know this being such a morrow-esque move is a lot of players proxy after they've lost the game yes this is the kind of guy that wins the game and then we'll cheese you out in game two yeah yeah well he did a a pretty quick attack in the last game right it was still a macro opener but he attacked very quickly and he's going to attack again here now that right there is a very quick reactor is that going to
(10:19) hurt Oliveira or is that going to help him being able to produce a couple of represented time very very good but having none to start that's a bit scary yeah I mean you know the reactor it takes a long time to make um the Taran is defense wise a bit naked here and as we all know when Reapers come out you just need a couple of them to stay alive and keep dealing damage and the game can snowball very quickly well right now Maru is waiting for that second Reaper you never go in with the first one because it gives away what
(10:49) you're doing you need that second one in case your opponent has a Reaper as well so here comes maru's second Reapers time to jump up there but the reapers are only halfway done for Oliveira right now he's gonna come in here he can maybe do not know he does not deny the factory from finishing but he could step first SCB uh looks at the second as he is going to be killed he comes in but he can't quite reach those Reapers a third SUV is going to be dropped as this is getting so bad for Oliveira it really
(11:14) really is the reapers are popping out so he has two now against three which is a little bit better but taking a lot of damage on his SUV's five falling already he's gonna have some more Reapers coming up the hellion is going to come out and greatly help it with this attack he does manage to escape and only drops one the regen's gonna kick in momentarily and those reapers are soon going to heal so right now it's 21 SUVs against 18.
(11:39) so it's a 3-4 SCB Advantage for Maru that's pretty significant but Oliveira already has his Command Center doing pretty well when SUV does get picked off can Oliveira cover his main and get that Command Center built this is quite the Dilemma because with the command center uh being made oh and he's going to actually come out here and watch this this is a pretty crazy move here by Oliveira is this actually an over extension he's going to retreat back over here to where the rest of the barracks are he needs a few more Reapers
(12:07) if he's going to take the fight that was a wild move because it of course would be possible for Mario to just run up into the main and start killing everything up there yeah it's definitely a possibility but it looks like Oliveira going to guard that area for now now and it did push him back all right I mean if you're gonna push him back and get your command center done I guess we have to give it to him it was a good move yeah um definitely a bit of a roll of the dice there uh but he pulls it off he he
(12:33) got in there he did that damage very cool to see uh he is going to send one Hellion up here luckily um Oliveira was able to actually lift the uh the Depots up and make sure that did not get inside and get any scouting done um but I have to say Oliveira has basically survived the rush he really has and he lost some SUVs for sure but his Command Center is quite a bit quicker so that is going to help him to catch up as far as that income goes you can see definitely Morrow ahead at this moment but that is going to change
(13:02) around a little bit this Barracks going around trying to get a scout as to what's happening and really I mean Oliveira I think did a pretty good job defending all said yeah and so now this game goes into basically a macro game uh as a standard and Morrow really is the guy by the way that that figured this part of the game out when you proxy with two barrackses you send one back home and then you use the other one to scout uh the year he won several gsls in a row we always saw him doing this and it's just it's a
(13:32) smart approach because this way you force your way in with the barracks you look around and you identify okay you're not like making another command center are you or anything else you're not switching into Mech are you and so he comes in here and gets that confirmed well one thing to mention is the barracks did not see that a Medevac came out so he might be a little bit surprised by this Maru has one of his own he's going to go ahead and do a seven Reaper drop as if that's something very common but yeah that's gonna be
(13:57) kind of cool this is a huge attack coming from Oliveira though and with Morrow having a lot of units across the map he's going to take a lot of damage look at this right now running up that ramp he's got to close that people oh double Cyclones here though oh but he manages to lock the rest of the units up inside the main but there's so many the Cyclone looks like it might be taken out he's kiting it so well so far oh my gosh and in that picture in picture right now you see that Maru as well getting a ton
(14:23) of damage with his Reapers picking off Tech units as well the siege tank and Marines of Oliveira breaking through the wall this is insane damage on both sides we can see Oliveira right now continuing to get right into the heart of Mario's base he's got to Banshee out he's repaired the Cyclones but does he have enough to actually take this on yeah hard to say the Cyclones come up and try to snipe that matter back they just barely don't get to the Banshee trying to get some damage on the very few
(14:51) marines that act as anti-air here they don't quite get it a lock-on from that Cyclone backs up but gets targeted down Mario Taps out GG as Oliveira ties it up one to one oh man what a move from Oliveira he blocks the proxy Barracks play he gets his expansion up and he does a massive attack Maru a king of Base trades ends up not doing enough damage himself not being able to hold on to that very vicious attack from Oliveira and it is now tied up one to one very cool game to see and what a different experience that
(15:31) was I've never seen anybody rush out and try to chase down the Reapers that he knows are basically camping outside of his main uh but it worked he chased him away it forced the barracks to supplant and we had a situation that I don't know about you artosis but I can't remember a game that quite looked like that because Mario had suddenly seven Reapers um that weren't lost in a fight right so he loads them up into a Medevac uh anywhere even sanitosis like that's a thing sends it across the

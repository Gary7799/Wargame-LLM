(18:09) is starting to do it here too every phase of this tournament we'd watch him he had some shaky moments but he would always come back uh fight his way through uh and and come out with a win and you know as dominated as Mara was in game number one Oliveira takes that win and uh let's see if we can if you can keep going all right we are going to go into game number three it's gonna be on Neo Humanity let's get it going all right guys I want to hear some noise in the audience in the upper left in the
(18:39) red he is Morrow [Applause] and in the bottom right in the blue he is Oliveira [Applause] earlier on the death segment zombie grub brought something up that I really uh appreciated her saying which was that this is uh another moment where Korea's position is under threat and this time it's not from European zergs yeah from a Chinese Terran right now it's important to remind everybody that China has had a very long history of amazing good Starcraft players they certainly have but in more recent years it's dwindled a
(19:33) little bit right like it really Oliveira is the only super well-known Chinese pro at this point like he is the he is the hope of the country and for him to come up that strong in a situation where not that many of his countrymen are really pro-gamers is even more impressive yeah I mean it's it if he wins here the uh impact that will have is going to be massive because Chinese fans are super loyal they're super supportive and um I mean I'm sure he's already right now a big inspiration to a lot of people in
(20:07) his home country oh absolutely I think he's a big inspiration of people all over the place to see him go on a run like this after not having the results that he probably dreamed of for many many years it's just it's such a wonderful story now he does poke up the ramp there and he gets a scout Maru started that Command Center on The High Ground may be hoping that Oliveira wouldn't end up seeing it but he sees it it's not on location so Oliveira will get like a slight Jump Ahead in this economy but Maru does have that much
(20:35) faster Factory you have Maru a little bit more conservative this game with that Command Center up in his main um and again this is all pretty standard stuff here as far as builds go so we're gonna have to have a little bit more time pass before this game can really unpack itself and we know exactly what kind of strategies these people are gonna do yeah it doesn't look like there's going to be any sort of uh very fast attack especially not like the last game even even from game one which was a little bit more delayed it doesn't look
(21:06) or feel like we'll really get an attack like that again from Maru foreign this time around um you know going with a very very different opening he did try his proxy um I think you know with Oliveira having that unique handling of actually barreling down the ramp and trying to take a fight uh and forcing the barracks to lift off Morrow doesn't seem to be interested in trying that again this time around um but you know the thing about Morrow that is so scary is that he has by far some of the best rushes out of all the players in all three of
(21:41) the races but he also has maybe the best end game ever you're right about that yeah yeah positionally he's number one macro wise he's number one well I mean everyone saw he has the highest rated player card overall the pros respect him more than everybody as far as his base skills go okay guns that down The Crowd Goes Wild Well Sue's Oliveira gets a unit you're like all right it's a real game let's go so that was kind of just a sacrifice from Maru you know the the Reapers don't
(22:17) really stay with a lot of power as the Taran verse Taran gets longer into it they don't fight anything particularly well so to jump it up get that Scout see what's going on that he's flipping it around to uh uh Tech Lab on the starport it's good information for Maru yeah certainly uh we've got the Medevac inbound here it's a third Command Center is being uh processed here for Oliveira um we have to watch right now and see what production decisions are going to be made here from morrow but if he
(22:44) starts to make more Barracks um this would be a game where Oliveira is going to be expanding and Marlo will have an opportunity to attack in and maybe do some damage omaru actually boosting into the main base here and he is gonna go ahead and drop a mine out immediately uh Burrows at mine unburrows for a moment lets it tank a little bit of damage and we'll see what he lets it Target oh it actually hits that SCB I think not so good Oliveira cleaning that drop up beautiful yeah borrow had some pretty crafty micro work there but
(23:16) ultimately Oliveira just smashed that attack and you know whenever you have a drop like that if it doesn't do any damage at all then it completely backfired and even the Medevac was picked off that's huge that is that is really gigantic like the the fact that he lost three units total this game is pretty crazy Oliveira having just perfect defense and so if Mara was going to be aggressive it's going to be a little bit more difficult to pull off over here um he might have to wait stem has started whereas for Oliveira the stem is
(23:50) way ahead so Oliveira is probably going to be a player who may try to activate on the map first tomorrow really actually holding off on getting stem for quite a while to get up other Tech yeah like that drop for instance but doesn't really do too much for him both sides getting their engineering Bays around the same time Mars Command Center not that far behind Oliveira's Oliveira already does have the orbital ready so we're gonna go ahead and see him get that third base landed and really start pumping out the mules really start
(24:19) getting the scds going yeah uh we have Maro setting the Raven out across the map it's going to be going northbound probably to try to Chuck some Auto turrets down and get some SCV kills you never want to let that Raven energy go to waste certainly not he did throw down that one Auto trip but Oliveira trying to chase down the Raven and he does get a lock on here can he actually get the kill oh my God Oliveira so on top of every aspect of this gauge is scanned at the last second to make sure that was actually taken out
(24:55) uh you know the Raven It's it really is like the Swiss army knife of the Terran Army there's so many things you can do with it from throwing Auto turrets down to disabling enemy units um and all of that is gone that Raven is out of the picture it got no value whatever is going to come out of the starboard is extremely important because Medevac you know do so much in tdt but at the same time banshees are strong but you have to have medevax for your army so actually taking that out is huge it really is it's like the most important
(25:24) early game Tech unit it does so much for you in fact as Oliveira moves across we may see some disables yeah we may see him try to bust in here all right he scans he sees the placement of three seed Shanks decides to go in a different direction oh my gosh he's splitting his entire Army he is getting ready possibly for a bust he has to scan he's going to come in there's a countertop s and Oliveira going to town with his Marines stimming forward so strongly into Morrow's position he's going to
(26:00) take out the Marines he's going to take out the tanks as well he's going to keep moving forward here Mario's gonna be in a lot of trouble artosis he really is his third has been pushed away Oliveira getting into the natural and now Maru with a drop into the main base he already eliminated that third base mining situation and now pick off a lot of SUVs but Oliveira has enough to push him out and some of the production facilities right now are down over this area two Barracks with reactors on him as Marines get gunned down as they come
(26:30) out oh man maru's still with so few Marines trying to get some damage done here and Oliveira has lost a lot of SUVs but at the same time Oliveira pummeling this natural expansion that 1C shank being repaired beautifully and he does have to pull back a bit but his Siege tanks still shelling this base combat Shield's about to finish Maru has to get rid of this push the tanks continue to Shell the command center oh he lifts it up Maru right now only mining on one base taking so much damage Oliveira up 30 Supply this is just unreal meanwhile
(27:09) it looks like the third Command Center for Oliveira has been landed Marlo going to go for a Hail Mary play a huge counter-attack across the map he's got two medevacs full of units coming out now Oliveira decides to back up and regroup oh no excuse me he's going to push back up this is such a chaotic game yeah this is this is really interesting Oliveira actually pulled very very far back here and then went back up a little bit so it seems like he knows something's happening a scan goes down from Maru decides better of dropping off
(27:38) in the natural instead boosting in that main base he needs to get some damage done here he's gonna try to unload over here I don't think there's enough Marines for Oliveira he's going to stem he's going to try to come in the SUVs are being mowed down it looks like there might just barely be enough Marines here he's going to pull the SUVs as well Maru picks up and is chased out all right he got six SUVs there but still a pretty good lead for Oliveira Oliveira re-maneuvering his Siege tanks here but
(28:05) Maru brings the Liberator a key unit from katowice this week in Terran versus Taran and he will push those back all right the Marines are gonna come stim in here he is gonna be able to Target down that tank uh and it just barely is killed in the nick of time but you know things are not getting better right now for Mario uh oh Oliveira is actually continuing to Shell into this main base yeah he's trying to get a lot of damage but really that Liberator is being a hero unit a lot of the Marines die for Oliveira now Maru coming up with
(28:34) the rest of his units in the main base and finally ends Oliveira's attack but after all of this Oliveira is up 14 scvs he's up a good 30 Supply and still has that strong Advantage with 2-2 almost done Mario is now going to try to push out this is pretty crazy I think he's his his game plan is basically that Oliveira is is desperate to finish the game and so what he wants to do is basically go for a counter-attack but I mean this is a mammoth Army here for Oliveira he has so much can you afford to have some of your army out on the map
(29:11) as Mario right now I think you can't afford not to taste this he has to make something happen he's so far behind Olive air though with the counter attack very quickly kills the third base Marr going to try to do the same he's going under this Command Center I don't see any way that he can save that meanwhile Oliveira is going to come in here he takes out the tank he's going to dive into the natural oh my god he has so many marines here stimming with those 2-2 upgrades down goes that Command
(29:36) Center as well GG Oliveira takes the lead 2-1 what is going on what is going on what is happening I'll tell you what's happening tasteless the birth of possibly a new best player in the world he's halfway there two wins all you need is four Maru um I mean here's the thing too our choses he's not playing poorly no he looks very strong we've had finals we've casted before where you know one player is just kind of falling apart whether it's nerves or exhaustion um or their playstyle just isn't working
(30:18) that's not what's happening here this is Mario playing at his very best yeah Maru Maru really is peaking right now like he is in great shape he won GSL code AS season three in 2022 and here he is getting to the finals relatively easily like he had some Road bumps but he got right up here he's been confident but Oliveira is just on another level here in katowice we're gonna go to a quick break when we come back we're gonna go to game number four in the grand finals of the Intel extreme Masters katowice

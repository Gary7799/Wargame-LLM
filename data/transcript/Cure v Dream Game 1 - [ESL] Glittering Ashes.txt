(00:00) two suvs go on a journey across the map to build some barracks and to have a laugh and it is going to be those proxy racks right in front of cures main base now cure gonna be just throwing up that barracks inside of his own main base that's singular barracks but adds on the second refinery a little bit faster yep second gas is one of the more common builds right 17 gas number two and this is just going to be safe typically this is going to be all right against the proxy but of course so much of it does come down to micro the worst
(00:36) case scenario here is you go one gas and then you look to expand your suv scout sees there's no barracks at the other side the maps then you can't expand you've got to throw bunkers up and so on this from dream is very much so pressure like yeah you want to do some damage but it's in no way all in you have a lot of plans behind this you have a way to transition you would like to get in do a bit of damage couple of suvs force a bit of a reaction if he can do that he'll be happy and he's mostly just looking to
(00:59) take control of the early game and then sort of make cure play his game rather than letting cure be the one to kind of drive the early kind of stages of this and i think a really important thing to note also is that it's not just not an all-in it's also a relatively common thing to see both these players are going to have a lot of experience against this is not some kind of strange crazy build by any way shape or form for either one of these players so as soon as cure got into that main base he knew
(01:25) roughly what he was probably gonna be up against and he's gonna try and do some a little micro over here the reaper versus reaper is very very close the suv gonna add in a little bit extra dps cure backs off with his own reaper and oh no oh my god dream killing it literally that's so bad for cure obviously he's just going to be a unit down from where he should be he's built a marine but the problem is a marine yes it builds faster but it's obviously not as sturdy as a rebate goes down straight away here and now these
(01:50) suvs keep on chasing we need this hellion to come out is that the first hellion he didn't even start until just now so the first heli is only just on its way and this is disastrous for cue you cannot lose your first reaper as easily as he did there's a reaper over here dealing damage as well and kira is down six suvs and dream has found a wonderful start and he's got a reaper count against a unit count of his opponent that probably still can't defend one hellion ain't going to make the difference here and you can see he's
(02:17) up he's fighting he's ready to keep this going a lot more suv is going down mine time continues to be lost what a start for dream an absolute disaster right now finally one of the reapers ends up falling over here the reaper is going to be forced to back off can we take a look yes the income advantage it's not just the 11 workers lost it's also the mining time of all of those suvs i think more than half the mineral line of cure has not been mining for almost the entirety of this game yeah two hellions are going
(02:45) to help to really make this a better defense than it was before but even then they will struggle if enough reapers get out and they start shooting at the right time so something for cure to be careful about as you just see a tackle up going down on the front obviously you can see how much trouble cure is in he can't afford an expansion he can't afford a star port these are all sacrifices he's making and leads in which stream is just developing over these next few moments this is a really tough spot now the tech
(03:11) lab is built on the barracks i'm gonna be swapped over to that factory that's gonna enable cure to start building some of those me meteor beefier units like the cyclone to help deal with things like these reapers reaper's going to have to make their slow journey across the map and try to evade as many of these helium attacks as possible and using those grenades does actually a pretty good job of getting out of there alive with most of those units which also means that the natural expansion for dream also gonna be a little bit
(03:38) easier to defend yep that should i mean he's just getting a great spot right like you know obviously kyogre couldn't feel as though he could be able to cross the map right what's he got to go across with and even if he starts to the cyclone's going to be here he's just going to be in such a great spot dream defensively yeah he's going to see this now the helens do you move they get a great first shot if there's going to be a way to get across it will start like that cyclone gets a
(03:59) lock on is going to get rid of one hellion and oh no he gets locked on too but he should be able to break with the high ground vision no no it's not there in time mistake from dream the reapers it was fine for them to stay there but they couldn't take that first shot for free all clumped up and then obviously the cyclone going down is actually a problem now cure can go across the map perhaps and maybe you'll find something for it you might actually find more than uh i think dream was wanting to let him get
(04:23) just because of the fact that the barracks of course had to fly all the way back home so yes there were the cycles being produced but losing the cyclone and all of the barracks units that you would have had means that there's almost nothing back at home there's that single cyclone that just popped out and now the raven it does seem like it's gonna be enough and this is a very cheeky maneuver lands the proxy bear and tries to make a marine which i think the hope there was that you cancel the suv building the command
(04:51) center the low ground doesn't quite work out but i i like that he's willing to do stuff like that yeah it's just a bit of a shame that dream gave him the map control because he could have very easily still just been on the map and had no issues oh no that's really turned into anything he still sits up by eight workers in this game he's catching back up in army's supply a third cc is building for him while his opponent's trying to get an orbital line on the natural yeah he'll lose one barracks but
(05:12) this was very much so to scout of course and yeah of course you also see just how late the starboard is from cure it just now finished dreams already got a raven on the map his second is about to pop i mean the advantages just keep on accruing here from dream it is it's really tough for kia like this is the sort of game where now you've just got to play it slow play from behind but so much of it feels as though you've got to have dream make a mistake and yes you can force mistakes to some extent but
(05:36) dream's about to have like a supply explosion very soon after this third cc we get extra barracks and then he's going to be like 20-ish army supply ahead pretty much always and he's going to have more raven energy so how do you then as cure for stream to make mistakes because your army doesn't feel good enough and yeah if dream just takes a few precautions and make sure he doesn't get like doom dropped or anything then it really feels like cura is just gonna have to sit back and wait for dream to make mistakes by attacking into
(06:00) him and i mean it just doesn't feel good right like you don't feel like you've got any control in the game right now as cuba based and i really do like given the fact that cure is in such a tough spot that he is just opting to say i'm gonna try and use information as one of the tools at my disposal i have some of the marines and yes i really cannot afford to lose too many of them but if i have spotters and i can identify an angle that you come in from once you have all those ravens so you have all of that
(06:28) spur of production that you were just talking about and that attack that we expect may eventually end up coming here from dream once he feels confident and safe that he can try and do something if he can identify the exact angle catch it on siege find these opportunities that is the way that you can come back in tbt and i think that is both the blessing and the curse of the match-up yeah i mean dvt is a weird one that regardless is going to be bad you just can't afford to lose a tank right i mean what do you even do there if you pull
(06:56) the suvs towards it they're going to get hurt they pulled to the corner there's so many low hp suvs from earlier i mean my goodness full workers anderson make it five we're gonna start dropping turrets in the natural and you can do this because you're just such in such a safe position you don't need to keep the ravens at home obviously don't lose the ravens or anything but this just extends your lead and dream is in such a great spot in this game one yeah i mean it's just crazy what a bit
(07:20) of early momentum can do and in a best of three scenario like this i mean it's dangerous you get one map lead and then cure is really on the ropes the rest of the series is something just happened on cue his camera and he's going to drop the paws so a few moments here as we have this first game of our best of three series our final match that we're going to be shown here on group a on the main stream and of course such an important one one of these players goes home one of them goes to the playoffs nice and simple
(07:45) just straight up one of the players is going to get to advance and we know the other one is not going to be able to so it is a tough one and i feel like this is already again we've been saying it's a tough start for cure but it is one of those things like you were saying is a snowball effect right after you take the economic damage you have fewer tools available so even just the fall of harassment of the raven harass and everything it's harder to defend against it's not just oh no look there's more
(08:10) mistakes being made it's oh you just didn't have the tools available anymore to defend against this so you get even further behind and i i have to compliment that i think cure doing a great or sorry a dream doing a great job with the situation all things considered you know uh one of the things i find funny is it's so nice to be able to say the players will go home if they lose again you know because for the last two years we've made the joke they go home but they're already there this time they
(08:37) can actually go home yeah the players will leave their home office the players will turn their monitor off and uh the players will go to netflix and they will close they'll close that browser and go to the next one the players will alter ulta4 and head over to netflix start binge watching some comedy shows cheer up their movies yeah yeah all right just a few moments here as we're going to get this resumed very shortly just getting qr sorted out i think i think it was just his camera fell down or something and probably
(09:08) knocked his desk or so so a few moments obviously not ideal in fact that is exactly what happened so his camera falls down his mic growing so hardcore he shook the earth so much his camera couldn't cope shook the core of the event just nothing really could stay stable against the pressure that this man puts on it's like we say this micro is going to rock your world yeah i mean he needs to get out of the coal that he's in steady supply down you know i was talking about that kind of explosion stage of the game right the
(09:40) supply seemed close despite what happened early but this is where we are now it's like a 24 worker difference the army supply lead is there as well it just gets worse and worse for kieran again you've got no choice other than to sit back hang around wait for dream to mess up attacking into you in a game that just doesn't feel good because you don't have control over that yeah and i mean even just these kind of pauses and stuff can make things feel even tougher just because it's basically being
(10:05) elongated your potential demise right it's the noose being hung around you and you're waiting you're just waiting for an opportunity to do something about it but it does seem like the game is about to resume we're hopping back into it and thankfully there's not a whole lot immediately happening there's no action or micro moments that are happening and either these players are going to be interfered with so they can get back to their usual business of what they were planning to do and for cure that's mostly just trying
(10:32) to bounce back from the auto harassment he took right before the pause happened a cyclone suv is a tank i mean it is just brutal ryden yeah i mean you can just go on and on but we've kind of said it all the upgrades if you want to add something else to the list one one done versus engineering sorry one one halfway done versus engineering based starting yeah across the board this is looking like a great start for dream this looks kind of like where you want to be at and like i say best of three with your tournament life on the line it's nice to
(11:00) get a 1-0 lead yeah it'd be kind of crazy if cue got knocked out i i do think dream is really good i think dream can make playoffs but i mean obviously you're gonna say there's a bunch in these groups right you've got players that deserve the playoffs but there's like four of them in a group right and then someone has to leave and just feel like q is the one that can make a good run you know it feels like he can go really far it feels like he overcame that kind of offline factor i remember the last time we had him here
(11:23) in poland we were talking a lot about him like you know he's the hot new taran right now how's he gonna do and it's again that kind of oh he's great online but not so great offline well that's not true anymore right he's shown that he can be great offline he's been at that gsl championship and he's taken the win so it would be really shocking if he does fall here but obviously gonna be an uphill battle because he's down basically one map already waiting for dream to dot the eyes across the t's
(11:48) we'll see if we can do it with this push i mean it is promising for me at least to see that dream is in fact playing the next level uh compared to the past and he is already turning this series in terms of the predictions around the score and history and everything so as we see the massive army of dream nearly doubling the supply of cures army pummeling on forward the c chance get ready to move into position cure is all siege up he is in the best possible spot he could be to help try and defend this outside of the fact that that refinery
(12:20) is gonna be a bit exposed and dream just gonna try and find a little opening over here that's going to make things even more complicated for cure if it wasn't tough enough already for him yep i mean he's because he's got the supply lead right he can just be his way into whatever position he didn't even have to bully his way to this position he just dropped across and he does start to lose out in his ravens a little bit so that's not ideal um but yeah i mean he's getting enough done right you force a lift on the
(12:45) natural you're just putting damage onto cure that he's again not gonna really be able to recover from as long as every so often you just check in and say hey you're still behind by right then he's pretty much going to be fine dream behind this taking a fourth base putting that in position no issues at all so yeah just looking good across the board here for dream i mean you've said it once said it twice dream really does have this game in his hands and you know cure right now if he wanted to
(13:09) win this was basically hoping that dream would try and drop in he loses everything before his sieges for example and then maybe he gets a bust on the other tanks with it being like half the army long reinforcement distance and maybe then right that's the momentum he needs to get a fourth base go across the map deal some damage denier base right you know any of those opportunities just that didn't happen walked across the map dropped in the natural and we were good to go yep this is definitely one of those
(13:32) matchups where positional play can sometimes overcome massive army deficits but this was not one of the situations where dream really allowed for it he was still pretty methodical about it he didn't really trade out super poorly to get into the position that he got into and like you said we're the fourth base and everything behind this now he's actually getting into position where he's now seizing air superiority which makes it even tougher because oh that last raven is gonna have a very hard time getting a whole lot done and
(13:59) i am actually i wouldn't even be surprised if dream just starts pincering in from the other side just to complicate matters even more for cure yeah i mean he really could he already had a little bit of an attack of that round performed didn't go too it was like okay but uh he's just gonna dive in over here he's obviously just gonna come through cure's not gonna stick around all too long he's gonna type out the gg and dream is gonna take the first map here and he's one map away from intel extreme masters pattern
(14:27) pizza playoff spot killer job and again it's just such a stellar start in the group being able to start up to zero i think really surprising a lot of people now again being up 1-0 against the player that he normally loses to especially lately especially in situations where it's usually a 2-0 or something so it's going to be a bit of a question that first game we all have we've talked a lot about how far ahead dream was but remember all of that was off the back of a very small moment right that was all
(14:59) off the back of one reaper versus one reaper everything began with one reaper dying which is crazy but that is actually tvt sometimes i can tell you a lot of games i've played where i lose my first rebrand and trust me i'm really good at lose my first reaper a lot of games i've played where you lose that first reaper and you just can't do anything right and it's the same here on this level when they can both micro so well losing that one reaper just takes away what could have been a slowing down of so many suvs and
(15:26) then it is a pressure rather than something that's doing so much damage that you can't recover from it it is a completely different game basically yeah i think it's just important to note that i still actually look at this series and i actually still favor cure i think he is still despite being 0-1 despite the fact that the past 10 minutes we've been talking about how far ahead dream is how well he's doing and everything i still think if most people will look at this series that they know cure and dream i
(15:53) think they would still say yeah i actually think that i would still probably place my bet on cure still be able to come out on top so i think dream getting some momentum is big he's gonna be feeling better about himself after that win where he was able to kind of indulge in that winning position for a while and now he gets to move into game two with a little bit of confidence and a little bit of leeway behind him as well absolutely definitely uh nice to see i'm just seeing if there's any scores coming through on the bottom
(16:20) side of the screen but there is not just thought oh there we go actually solo 1 0 versus nib and rogue one o versus spirit so maybe nothing too surprising there on the other streams which of course you can check out if you would like to obviously dream 100 here against cure and readying up for a game at number two waiting to see just what we maybe do depend on the map you know i know dream likes to mac a little bit i know he's been doing a bit in tvz but in tvt as well i said this about you thermal sometimes he's a bit of a mech player
(16:48) and dream is kind of that guy as well be a little bit weird be a little bit different could be interesting depend what the map is of course some absolutely a bit better for it some maps a little bit worse quite frankly so yeah i think that's entirely fair i know that we did talk a lot about you know who is gonna advance on from this match in particular who the winner of this is just gonna advance on it is worth mentioning that the other two players in the group who we pretty much know are gonna be advancing on now solar and rogue both
(17:16) sitting three and one in their series score both sitting at the same overall uh maps differential as well and it's important to note that the winner of the group whoever gets first place in the group doesn't just go to the playoffs i go to the playoffs in the round eight everyone else is going to be going around at 12 and what that means is you effectively skip around and we're not talking about skipping around versus like i don't know someone wordy in the open bracket or something myself in an
(17:43) open world we're talking about skipping around against a potential player like a cyril like a rainer like a maru this is so valuable to be able to top your group so if you are interested while this series we're just starting to get the game number two underway i'd highly recommend checking out also katz's stream who's also streaming with some of these matches as well as the esl underscore sc2b stream absolutely again solar two zeros he's top of the group if you two ones you can get top of the
(18:10) group of rogue also goes to you once that's the the timeline there in terms of how things could turn out again these two are just straight up scrapping for getting ahead in the group and obviously just advancing but actually worth mentioning while right now these two are obviously in you know position where the winner advances they could still advance in second place if whoever you know one of rogue or solo lose they could get second place i don't know how much of a difference that really makes everyone's
(18:34) freaking good in the round of 12 anyway you know that is very true it's uh it's hard to get a good seat in the sense that you have an opponent that you're like yeah thank god i got such and such person can you imagine i mean he gets second place another group is like oh thank goodness i got cue or dream right yeah it doesn't really work like that hey well we're getting ahead of ourselves as we are still just finishing up this series right here i'm starting in game number two down here in the bottom right

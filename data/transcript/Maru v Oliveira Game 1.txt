(00:00) start the grand finals of the Intel extreme Masters Academy say 20-23 with Maru versus Oliveira [Applause] so it's all going to come down to this moment they've had to prep their builds they've had to go over exactly how they're going to approach each map will there be cheese will it be a macro game but it's now or never our ptosis yep the map is loading up we're gonna go to Dragon Scale Spurs a very important game number one in this best of seven let's get it started down here in the bottom right in the red
(00:42) he is Mario [Applause] and his opponent in the upper left in the blue from China he is Oliveira [Applause] right now right here game number one this is where you set the pace for how you are going to approach this match I feel like it is a very important game for Oliveira because Maru has so much experience in Grand finals right he's won so many top tier tournaments for Oliveira like he hasn't done that but he's beaten the players who have he has played completely solidly he is mixed in a lot of tricky stuff as well what are
(01:37) we going to see from him what does he do in the most important match literally that you can ever have in Starcraft 2. it's going to be so interesting to see and I think you're 100 right arto says I don't think that maro's heart rate changes at all as he walks onto the big stage yeah in one of the most important moments in his Starcraft career but for Oliveira you know obviously he's a player who comes into tournaments like this I think with the best attitude you can have which is I'm gonna get as far
(02:06) as I can right well he's gotten farther than pretty much anybody else he's now here with Morrow the last two players left yeah and how do you how do you hold in your excitement how do you keep those nerves steady well he's done it so far he's come from behind against the best players in the world world champions giant tournament champions without any problem so I don't know what it is about Oliveira that has changed but it feels like he is up to the task so we've got the two players scouting
(02:36) each other out right now nothing too crazy so far as far as far as builds we didn't have any proxies we didn't have any super greedy expansion plays but for now we're just going to see both players Tech up to the factory that's right a quicker reactor here for Maru so going to give a little boost to his production while Oliveira just continues to make Reapers one at a time command centers on the way at exactly the same time as well very very similar builds but not 100 the same and there are many different
(03:06) branches from this point here in the build that they can go into so we're going to wait a little bit more and then kind of see what direction this game is going to go we have both players taking a command center that's very standard but tvt over the last couple years has proven to have some very interesting and sometimes very Scrappy two two base fights yeah and in fact we could see something like that here for instance if we just keep going on the production of helion Reaper for Maru then that reactor
(03:34) will kick in and he'll actually have more Reapers than Oliveira that might be a time that he wants to attack as the game goes on here the reapers are going to be gathered up over here at the entrance same thing uh over here for Maru as well now we have had a game at this tournament I can't remember off the top of my head which one it was where both players literally went by each other on the map the way this map is shaped moving from the bottom to the top or from the top to the bottom uh it's occasionally you can end up with one
(04:00) player on one side the other on the other so we want to watch for that here because the belts are so far similar enough they may end up having a similar timing attack here yeah that definitely could occur now we have a cyclone coming out for Oliveira a little bit more standard he does have that mine at the front as well just in case any attacks come up Maru on the other hand getting that Medevac very quickly as well as a siege tank so we do see a little bit of deviation in both sides and it seems like Maru is going to be the first one
(04:29) that really tries to either attack or harass his opponent yeah I'm not too surprised to see him being the first one that might be active on the map here we do have a raven for Oliveira about halfway to completion here pretty standard stuff as the Medevac is going to pick up for Morrow headed Northbound over here meanwhile the rest of his forces are going to be probably coming out to the ramp over at the entrance uh Oliveira's base there's a block I should say there was a blind spot up in the mail but he's going to go over here he
(04:57) will be able to see that uh it looks like the intentions here for Mario to try to elevate our units up into the main like this he does get the tank now uh up inside the Medevac and then dropped off over here within range of the star ports oh this is going to be tough to break does he wait for a raven spell he sieges up a tank here Oliveira is starting to take a bit of damage on his buildings Maru going around the outside of his base so far so good here for tomorrow he's splitting pretty nicely this tank is
(05:22) still alive time may be falling apart already oh man Maru Maru kill almost on the seat check as well as a lot of units he ating up a lot with this Medevac as well maru's first attack looking so strong and auto turret's gonna go down here as the SUVs are pulled the tank goes down the hellions now being pushed up against the wall but it's still so much damage eight SUVs have been taken out so far this is an incredible amount of damage put on from Maru to kill that many SUVs he is way up in workers plus 10 in that regard
(05:54) there are some things going for Olivia like he has a couple Ravens but this attack isn't even done yet this is not supposed to do this much damage already more SUVs are going down the tank and the Marine are going to come in here and try to chase this out but the workers keep getting picked off oh man it already GG is called Maru takes game number one about as quickly as you can in this matchup okay so I think that could have gone better for um for Oliveira but you could see there were some small errors in the execution

(37:02) personally in my mind and I'm sure in the mind of a lot of people watching you go uh oh this does not look good but we could have been more wrong as now Oliveira is in the lead in the upper left in the red from Kareem [Music] and the bottom right in the blue from China he is Oliveira Oliveira gaining a lot of new fans here this week no doubt about that cases what happens if he starts to gain a lead in game number four against tomorrow can Maru keep his mentality solid I don't know what's gonna happen if Oliveira
(37:55) wins the next game I'm going to look at you and realize like oh my God our toes is we're in the wrong timeline getting the DeLorean yeah it's it's so wild I didn't think I would ever see something like this like someone rise from kind of a middle of the road Pro Gamer you know someone that's he's good he'll be at the tournament but you don't think about him to challenging Maru to being ahead of Maru in the world championships yeah I mean this is truly the greatest dark story Dark Horse story excuse me uh
(38:26) ever in the Intel extreme Masters and um look like I said before the break he's done it twice he's already halfway there yeah he just needs to win two more um so what I'm looking for as we go into this game is how exactly is Marlo going to play there are not very many best of sevens where Mario gets behind and stays behind no certainly you're right about that uh and one thing to mention about Maru like I think that he's going to be mentally fine at least for now like yeah he lost those two games but he has won
(39:00) so many championships things go wrong on those paths and you know he's definitely got the skills to come back we should mention as well uh Oliveira is his ID before was time many of you have been watching Starcraft in years past may be wondering who is this guy this is Time same player just a new ID um and yeah I mean right now he's playing extremely well these games by the way are almost impossible to recreate they're very specific uh things that are happening in these games where there's a lot of moving Parts
(39:36) um and each one stands on its own as a very unique experience you know some games somebody just gets a build order win other games it's kind of your standard back and forth late game macro game these are some real Cutthroat rough tvts where we're basically finishing the game right at Mid game yeah yeah maybe even before right like they're attacking each other so early and so often like the unit sets that they're fighting each other with are almost random it's like okay this is what I have that survived and that's
(40:06) what you you made to try to hold me off and now you're counter-attacking with that and it's just it's not the standard stuff you'd normally see in a Terran versus Darren will it continue that way or are we going to get any of the long positional macro games maybe that is a place where Maru can outplay Oliveira yeah but that would require Mara to be very inactive on the map right he'd have to be in a very defensive position and you know map Patrol and TBT is extremely important um so we have Oliveira now out on the
(40:35) map he's positioned so that he has three Reapers over here um just to the right of Morrow's main base and a helium to spot at the bottom uh this doesn't mean he's going to try to attack in here but it could simply be to try to catch any units that might move out we've got the first Medevac is this going to be a drop it is and look at this a tank Reaper's moving out Marines inside the Medevac oh Oliveira actually catches those Reapers so he knows something is going on and it's actually a very similar attack to what
(41:05) we saw in game number one here from Maru he's bringing the tank he's bringing the Marines but some of his units got caught on the way there so let's see if Oliveira has time to stop this he goes and gets the lock on on this meta deck if he kills a matter of fact it is huge and the Medevac goes down immediately Marines are isolated over here he targets it down oh my God in the meantime his own Reapers in the main base getting some damage there as well tomorrow with a smirk on his face because Oliveira not only shuts down his
(41:40) attack but gets more damage with less units on the other side of the map it's doubly bad right now for Morrow losing workers the rush was shut down and Medevac now out of the picture but it seems like he's going to double down it's actually very interesting having Mario's show uh emotion on his face yeah he's almost always expressionless well I mean he's in a little bit of shock here because literally everything is going wrong for him and everything is going right for Oliveira it's it's wild uh
(42:08) right now Maru like he keeps coming across the map but everything gets held off Oliveira has plenty of units to defend so I think Maru has to take a few risks here you see him building a third Command Center on the expansion instead of the main base he's got to start optimize rising to try to catch up and maybe get ahead later on we're having a Reaper come in here and try to peek and see what's happening um I I could not believe how well that fight went even the Cyclone living yes out of all like it literally could not
(42:38) have gone better for Oliveira now again tomorrow is very good went up against the ropes here but um right now I can't imagine a game going better right now here for our Chinese players oh you're you're definitely right about that like so far this is the perfect opening uh but you know Mario's actually I think what Mario's doing here is very very intelligent okay so he went third command center right away and he's going mostly Vikings and tanks he's slowed down his own stem he's slowing down
(43:05) Marine production and he's just going to try to get these units that scale very well the longer the game gets the better Vikings and Siege tanks are and he's just gonna try to get there but Oliveira is coming in he might be going for a kill move all right he's going to come in here probably try to disable any tank he can uh he saves it actually he's got another disabled already the Vikings are going to be shot down he throws down Samano turret here in a tank all right those autocorrects going to have been enough
(43:33) sieges up there was a disable there one of his tanks lands his own Vikings and GG all about is a three to one oh my God this is insane this is insane the biggest upset finals in Starcraft 2 history I've never seen anyone have such a good time while playing the final match at the World Championships Oliveira is getting into it he is dominating this is I can't believe this and these are fast action-packed tvts that was a masterful takedown of the drop and the excellent Split Second decision making to send the reaper in to

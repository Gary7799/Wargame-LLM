(19:03) hand side of the map on top of the red taran player from dragon phoenix gaming he is cure [Applause] in the upper left-hand side from good game gaming some say he is a good gamer it is dream i think it's hard to argue with after that last game and last game is opponent good game to me at the end as well i mean the good game actually comes from his opponents that's true he's the he is the gamer that causes good games there's a c in there [Laughter] [Music] no suvs going across the map super early this suv movie now now obviously is just
(19:51) a scout and that's cure being very safe double gas and in the scout is what he did last game and that is again kind of safe because usually with double gas you kind of feel good to hold most things because you believe in your micro yeah obviously last game he messed up the micro lost the reaper but this is really just him saying i think if i just make sure i know exactly what's going on give myself the best info possible i'm confident later on whereas dream is more willing to cut corners he does take
(20:16) double gas as well but he doesn't scout because he just believes i'll be okay and maybe that little bit of corner cutting not scattered with an suv but of extrico it's just slightly better for me and given the fact that he is up 1-0 i don't hate that decision as well willing to just try and potentially get little advantages wherever he can cutting some corners uh i do want to bring up the map because pride of all taurus is an unordinary map and we often times see it vetoed and everything but frankly warty
(20:44) dvt i think is not the matchup i usually think of on this map so break it down for us what do you usually expect when you see a tvt on pride of all taurus well it's just a big map right so you expect it to be split you expect a lot of time to respond and you expect maybe your left versus right dynamic in terms of one player pushes this way one player pushes that way i think the reason this map comes up in this series following you know following up glitter and ashes it's very simply they just want to play big maps the
(21:10) smaller the map in tvt the more volatile it is because if you're not ready for the push out or you don't see him coming you get sieged in your base you're in trouble so this gives you the most possible time to see this and to react it's a bit bigger so drops and stuff a little bit more you know possible to go around but obviously you can also later in the game have those sensor towers you see the drops this is very much so just a case of removing the volatility early game they both want to play a longer
(21:32) game it would generally seem to say letting these two maps come through and yeah on this map specifically one of the interesting things the one thing that this map did that no other map had done in the ladder before it has four different layers right so you've got the low ground in the middle of the map then your next layer up it comes into the third and fourth base then a layer up into the natural layer up into the main and one of the coolest things that actually does to a map is that it means that every base is upper high
(21:56) ground so not just as your main more defendable your naturals more defendable but then also your third and fourth is more defendable so everything about this map encourages a longer game and i really love that uh you bring that up just because that is one of the newer map features it was physically impossible in some of the previous maps until there was a update that actually allowed that yeah last uh editor update allowed it and they straight away said yeah make some maps like uh last time we had a map contest which is where pride
(22:21) of altars came from they were like oh yeah you know make some maps like this you know what's cool it worked so well that now it's just allowed as a standard feature it's not like special or anything like that it's just allowed and it does work well unless you put like 17 clips next to each other then it's a bit ridiculous but on maps like this you don't really notice until you're like oh yeah four layers you know it just seems so natural which is really cool and we definitely know that sometimes a
(22:45) high ground vision and a high ground situation can matter a lot when it comes to the tvt trades the engagements the sea tank positioning and whatnot and even just some of the early game skirmishes but funny enough neither of these players as they're seeing a from a wonderful observer have really gone out very far into the map they really have just been keeping to their own side for the most part a little bit of movement out there from cure but both of these players staying very very close to the chest with their
(23:11) units yeah with the size of the map it almost feels like you get mounted back aggression going these builds are so tight in tvt you're looking to hit when like something is halfway done but on this map it would basically be finished already by the time you get there so no surprise that they're basically mirroring each other and just going into a very strong macro game and that setup uh third cc starts a little faster from dream he's just been a little bit ahead throughout and that's just not scp scan
(23:33) that's one of the main things and just those little edges right so he's maybe just being a little bit greedier and now he's taking some leads now cure still not building the third seas he really says he's going to go across and try and do something we'll see if he can find some openings if he can brilliant but if not he's in a bit of trouble because that third is so much faster from dreams we'll see what kyo can do starting to push out right now i would imagine he'll take a third
(23:55) on location as he moves out at least i think that would make a lot of sense and we did see just for a brief moment dream spots out the army positioning over here at the third base i think he would have seen where the third basil would have been planted down so if nothing else dream saw that the third base had not been started on location immediately he's gonna poke back in and seize that command center gets all the information he really needed from those reapers they really did their job yeah nice to get confirmation of that he
(24:22) says hey look you're not moving out i'm gonna send my ravens out you know if your army is just right there i do not need them defensively let's make use of that energy we saw how much he was able to do with that last time around see if we can do it again there's still potential for q to attack that later third you know and he's also not invested into engineering base or extra racks yet like dream has so he's still been building more army and that's where the army advantage is from and so it's a
(24:43) little dangerous because what happens obviously as we matrix cyclone to stay safe we will all deter the natural it just means that cure has a bit army supply that you can go across map with but again if he doesn't do anything stream is just setting up to have a really great game from like the eight or nine minute mark this is the push from cure that needs to find something to slow dream down a little bit and a little bit funny because the ravens have now used a good chunk if not all of their energy doing
(25:08) that little harassment and one of the harassment attacks really didn't accomplish almost anything so now the raven has to find a way back home safely as it's gonna be moving potentially straight over the army very soon the raven actually ends up hole positioning over there because the army is gonna just break out to a fight over here cure seizing an opportunity interferencing matrixing the siege tanks taking out the rest of these units what a stream really got right now no nothing he really didn't know what was happening cue took
(25:34) the very long way around with his units took a bit of an odd path and so dream just never saw it coming he really believed he was just going to sit back and defend his third base he was not ready for this attack at all this was the moment in which cure had to deal damage dream has upgrades almost finishing and barracks producing add-ons two minutes from now dreams in an amazing spot but that was the moment for cure and it was just especially with dream not knowing it was coming on top of everything dream was building just
(26:00) way too much and that's why it's such a one-sided fight tbt man it is a brutal matchup i mean we've seen two brutal losses in a sense where the first game we were talking about the single reaper that just snowballs into all of these cascading effects of things that go wrong from that and in the second game a game where it looks like both these players situating very similarly one small difference of the third base timing and everything but imagine if we had a player who was ready to defend with also
(26:29) potentially even some raven energy if the ravens are back at home small decisions that can cost you the game like that tvt i feel like one of the most brutal matchups for that kind of thing yeah i think dream got a bit ahead of himself i think if he's just playing kind of a bit more army focused himself he could maybe justify some of those ravens out but he sort of got he went for everything it wasn't just sending the ravens out it was engineering base and the barracks and set up for the future and he sent the ravens out to try and
(26:54) deal damage and that was just looking for a little bit too much and obviously like we said cure defended it well he didn't take much damage even if he lost like six seven eight suvs there it doesn't change the attack that hit stream you know kia probably still wins the game in the same way so it just kind of goes to show how meaningless the ravens were in basically going to harass versus if they'd been at home to defend it could have made a difference right it could have been a hold maybe not you know if dreams still
(27:17) didn't know what was coming the ravens probably don't make enough of a difference but it would have given you a much better shot and obviously if you then knew what was coming having the ravens at home would have been really important to the defense well that is going to be something to soak on in as we think about where map number three will lead us you were mentioning earlier wordy also that the maps that we've been seeing so far are some of the bigger maps and i think as we start moving away from those larger
(27:41) maps the game does become a little bit more volatile with those kind of positional move outs and it's kind of funny that we were talking about that because in a sense this same kind of fear that we just had on like smaller maps effectively was realized on a larger map there where there's a move out and you're not aware of it and it catches you very suddenly by surprise yeah no absolutely um let's go into bill and grant talk about small maps this really is the polar opposite of what we've just been seeing in the bottom

(45:28) the line for the rest of the night if he wants to be the world champion this year he must go three and zero it's time for that comeback as we now go into our next game all right kind of you'd say let's make some noise down here in the bottom left from Korea he is Maru [Applause] his opponent in the upper right in the blue from China he is Oliveira foreign packed so many Starcraft fans coming together here in katowice you guys are fantastic yeah it's so good to be down here and casting these games to you guys
(46:23) uh and what a hell of a finals yeah so um going into this next game we have to remember that Morrow does not have the luxury of trying uh any kind of weird all-ins or throwaway builds one thing about a best of seven is the bigger range you get in score like let's say that uh you know you're up 3-0 right and you just have to win one more game to win that best of seven well then you can start doing really weird all-ins you can throw a couple in because even if it doesn't work okay fine then I'll go back
(46:58) and I'll play a macro game in the next game but when you have when you're down one to three you have to basically make every perfect decision for how you're gonna open up yes yes and that's so tough right uh you can't actually account for everything if your opponent is willing to take a couple risks there's just there's an area where you're going to be weak and they might be able to find that out now as of right now looks like we are just going to have a Reaper expansion coming down here from Oliveira whereas
(47:30) it is a Reaper into Factory here on Maru remember that these games have been extremely explosive um often times with Maru actually the first to act yes that last game that we saw back there the um the the tank uh tucked into the Medevac along with a couple of Marines and moving out that's not a normal build we don't see that in all the tvts this seems to be something new he's been tinkering with and in one of the games that was how he actually beat Oliveira but um where does Mario want to take a game
(48:03) like this now um I I you know tvt it does seem like you can't really be too passive in it you have to be fairly active on the map uh counter-attacks are so dangerous because stem Marines in small numbers are so deadly and medevax make them so mobile also if your opponent gets a strong position on you if you're just kind of sitting there and they run up in Siege near a command center you're going to lose that area like you're just you're not going to be able to break an equal amount of units that are already
(48:31) positioned so that does make it so that there's a lot of roaming about a lot of little scuffles where you try to gain that edge keep your opponent off your back and maybe sneak into their side of the map for now it looks like Mario's just gonna go for a 1-1-1 just about to finish up his star Port as the Factory's producing hellions and the barracks is producing Marines um Morrow is going to just take a peek up here with the reaper Oliveira is ready to swat that away doing a good job so far he's got that
(49:00) bunker in the front he was blocking the Reaper jumping Mario just gets a little bit of information but doesn't know too much about exactly what's going on in all of Aerospace so the first tank comes out the Medevac is almost done I'm curious if Mario is going to go on the move again um and if he's going to try to be aggressive he doesn't have to right but a lot of times with the first medivac you see players do something it's the same build as before yeah yeah he's really liking this build it you know it
(49:28) very similar builds at least going one and one so far but with his life on the line he's decided let's do this again this is really interesting you don't normally see Morrow stick with the same build unless it's you know proxy racks a couple games so I guess he wants to try to hit the main okay but you see Olive air is already ready he's got a siege tank up there not just a siege tank a viking tasteless to help push away that Medevac and as Mario sees it he boosts out of there but look he didn't lose a lot of
(49:58) units no that's like a Reaper so it's not the end of the world what just happened there this is fine this is totally fine because he manages to keep the Medevac alive it's still it can be used later on a raven's being made he might try to incorporate that with the next little jab in yeah Mario is bringing all of his units to the front there once again gonna Siege up on this bunker so you know that's a little bit annoying for all of air he's going to go ahead unload the bunker maybe he'll sell it as well
(50:22) uh but Maru like are you gonna get real damage right there I don't think so he's just he's rotating around he's trying to apply some pressure here to his opponent and one thing to note is that you know that might have looked kind of like a little a bit of a weird Skirmish like he sieged up shot the bunker and backed up he's actually taking a third base so you know he's generating the illusion of threats uh and then he's gonna pull back yeah it's a smart way to play right absolutely
(50:48) Medevac going to come in here now I believe there's one Hellion in here I think that's probably more for scouting than anything else uh he does get to see basically what's going on he sees that additional Command Center being built so some good information here for Mario he's traded a few units here and there to to learn these things and that's why he is down in Supply a bit but I don't think it's a big issue this game this this doesn't feel like the other the last three games that we saw it's not
(51:13) like he's super far behind or anything yeah I actually think this is so far the best game we've seen from morrow but we need to see you know now that Oliveira's turn you know with his later expansion he's going to have an opportunity to attack how is Mario going to handle it most of Marlo's losses have been backfired uh you know aggressive this is a totally different situation and he's coming up right now Oliveira is for that same type of attack that he wants to make but when he scans here I don't
(51:40) think he's going to go in like it's basically the same units for Mara that Oliveira has so again to attack into something like that is incredibly difficult he's chasing that Cyclone which is going to be pulling around here again you want to watch those Ravens they could try to shut down the tanks both players have that opportunity on either side Oliveira unseatures again Marlo looks like he's going to try to set up a line of defense over here Oliveira doesn't have to try to come in but it looks like
(52:06) he might try to tiptoe these tanks forward yeah it sets up a little Siege right here that's going to be a little bit annoying it looks like he's hitting the command center when he does get vision of it right so the tanks can shoot a little bit further than they can see which is an important thing to keep in mind that's why Vikings become so powerful that Raven takes quite a bit of damage Oliveira unseaging deciding to go for he throws down the auto turrets I don't know if this is going to end up
(52:31) working but he does go forward Maru pulling his SUVs going forward with those Marines immediately and will Oliveira actually be able to hold this position yeah the target firing there for Maro was just too good he realized what's happening with the auto turrets and just Target fired over the top but you know what these tanks are starting to get a little bit lower here our doses yeah Olivera Landing those Vikings down they do deal a lot of damage to see James but somehow Maru keeps three tanks at very low Health alive that is a net
(53:01) win tomorrow I would say oh huge win there had he lost the tanks it would have been more of a trade but good juggling there with the medevax it's interesting to see that you know Oliveira has an alternative approach to trying to break certain siege tank lines where he does use the auto turrets over the disable yeah uh and you know a lot of that the burden then becomes on the defending player to manually Target with the siege tanks over just let the um uh you know the the game the tank default into whatever is closest to them
(53:31) all right now Maru deciding it's time to move out across the map he probably is feeling pretty good about his position right now he's been mining from that third base a little bit longer than Oliveira has had his he's got those Siege tanks as well that stayed alive during the fight so here we go he's going to move up he scans no tanks here this is a problem for Oliveira yeah Oliveira is looking pretty weak right now the bunker is taken out I see one siege tank on the low ground and that's
(53:58) not going to be there for very long oh man actually Maru kind of over commits with his Marines there I want to say that diving in on those tanks he did deal a lot of damage then but he didn't quite kill them off he lost a lot of Marines and I think he has to back up yeah that was a bit of a lackluster attack it didn't seem like there was much you know to much follow-up with that he's going to try to pick off this one tank now he could Target the Vikings Vikings are very slow at running away on the ground but Morrow is just over
(54:28) extending here artosis it feels like he tried to lay a trap there with that one tank the Vikings land he stimmed up to try to get them but Oliveira was pretty quick he stimmed down fought those Marines off a little bit and saved a couple Vikings so probably a good trade for him there so I would say Oliveira you know not in a great spot this game but Morrow hasn't really been able to leverage his position uh and honestly there was some pretty uh pretty bad moves pretty bad plays technically there from mono
(54:58) outside of Oliveira's base uh it looks like Mario's gonna come around here and try to hit over here at the third he's going to stim in now I see three seats here for Alabama let's see what Mario can get done he targets one of them down immediately oh my gosh stimming forward here he gets another one he will have to pull back the rest of his Marines here a lot of them end up dying Oliveira going with a counter attack towards that third base Mario sees it coming and he lives off he's trying to run out but a lot of
(55:22) SUVs going down he's taking out so many he's now going to try to fight those Marines and he does manage to take them out as well a big Interruption here for the income of Maru oh Mario comes down with his SUVs to fight with some Marines as well Vikings pushing back the Medevac but loses quite a few SUVs he does drop down below Oliveira's economy for now the tanks are now going to be pulled back a big victory there for a very small attack from Oliveira 16 scbs have been killed yeah oh man this game definitely a lot
(55:55) closer than the others though Maru right now setting up that fourth base location with a planetary so that it's going to be able to defend itself a little bit now we're watching the first person view here of Maru spreading out his Siege tanks sieging them up trying to keep an eye on anywhere that Oliveira could attack him yeah you could see he's so fast so efficient he is ahead in a base by the way um so that's very comfortable for him he's got an extra income um Oliveira is actually backed off you
(56:24) know he's uh needs to continue to try to keep growing here and moving out on the map because if you're on three bases versus four and you stay on three bases either you need to be attacking and winning or you need to be double expanding yourself well I think Oliveira may have just taken his own fourth base there we saw a sensor Tower go up Maru saw that as well so trying to catch up uh looks like Maru kind of roaming the map here once again yeah there is that fourth command center it's not done quite yet but very very close with the
(56:53) sensor Towers there though it's very hard to attack your opponent will see you coming there is a blind spot for both players here in the middle of the map it looks like Oliveira may end up having an encounter here with Morrow stimming and coming in but a flank over here on the side from Maru reinforcements for Oliveira coming down the ramp now Oliveira stimming up he has a ton of Marines here and in fact he will start to beat the Marines but the siege tanks adding so Firepower here he's there Morrow decides to go back and
(57:23) lick his wounds some more tanks are gonna unseege over here as well Oliveira yeah unsure of where to go now he certainly doesn't want to try to push in any further I think that would have been a pretty egregious over extension one thing I do want to mention Oliveira actually getting his 3-3 Marine upgrades before Maru does so that's something that will you know help him out quite a bit when he gets him if you're up in upgrades your Marines will fight far far better but of course Siege tanks going
(57:51) to be a key element of those attacks as well both sides are doing a great job with keeping up with their Tech upgrades are getting pretty crazy the tank count overall is actually a lot better for Mario um now that being said you know tanks are pretty brittle versus Marines if they ever get you know exposed at a spot um where the Marines can gun them down so if Oliveira is going to try to you know come out ahead we want to watch and see if he can get any good tank Snipes that being said it looks like Mario's
(58:18) actually gearing up for a push yeah trying to come up and hit this base over here right now that's really scary that's a huge Army from Maru he is up in Army spy by about 20 right now and Oliveira has a little group of Marines to the sides that is not going to be too useful in this fight right now he's not oh I see what he's doing he's gonna unseed these tanks over here he's gonna go around up onto the high ground and start to Shell this base now we can see these marines over here in the
(58:45) picture in picture they do take out this Command Center yeah but Maru is shelling a lot over here as well oh a bear though clearing those tanks with a double Medevac drop very well done on defense and suddenly the game looks pretty even yeah um you know it is a funny thing sometimes these much smaller counter attack does way more damage than the big heavy push and that was one of those moments um I think Mario lost a decent amount of Tanks is it possible that the tank count is actually ahead here for Oliveira it
(59:19) is 10-6 he is in the lead that is a big deal that is a big deal six tanks will still do a good good job defensively and they're going to have to because Oliveira looks to be getting ready to attack he's coming down Maru backs up down a ramp that is a very choked off area so it would be hard for Oliveira to attack there okay he's gonna try to come up onto The High Ground he scans again and Oliveira I think is being pretty smart he doesn't want to be in a position where he can ever uh overextend
(59:47) so he backs up and Marlo also pulls away as well I think wisely so yeah there is a lot of heavy Army movement right now around the map if you lose track of where your opponent's Marines and tanks are you can die very very quickly that's why we're seeing these scans over and over just double checking are you sitting there sieged are you moving around which direction are you going into these are incredibly important things that they must keep track of Command Center going to be planted over here at 12 o'clock uh we're about to get
(1:00:18) to the fifth base up here for Oliveira but Marlo has plans to try to deny that he's sieging up here on the low ground and scanning and hitting Oliveira's tanks yeah that's a very good siege there from Mario kicking off a couple tanks almost for free still roaming looking like he wants to deny the spacebar I don't think that he he can right like Oliveira has a lot of tanks on The High Ground his Marine Force very strong as well in fact both sides are maxed out with three three upgrades on their Marines and plus to
(1:00:46) attack on their tanks yeah both players are basically growing up into the upper left corner of the map uh Oliveira's position is a little bit more of a triangle here in the top right where it seems like Morrow is kind of going more up into a straight line but as I say that he also expands down into six o'clock and let's not forget Morrow is very scary when it comes to these huge intense macro games he's very good at growing pushing and continuing to have good production he's incredibly fast so that is definitely the case now
(1:01:17) a little double Med of that drop here picks off a few of those tanks gonna kill a couple turrets and whatnot gets rid of the sensor Tower uh an okay move there from Maru just trying to keep pressure on once again Morrow with a big attack over here and the tank is gunned down immediately is he going to try to shove it no he backs up and relocates suffering very little losses I love these moves that we're seeing from Maru he's actually starting to spend some of his Marine Force he's sending them in on these little missions
(1:01:48) that he knows that they're going to get destroyed during and that's allowing him to attack towards the end game you can see now a lot of star ports are up he's making a lot of ravens he's getting more Vikings he's adding more star ports because these as the game gets longer become more and more important he's gonna shell down these rocks over here trying to make the map a little bit more open so he can maybe have some more opportunities to hit but I got to tell you man uh Morrow is getting very scary
(1:02:16) as far as growth we're having four um excuse me four liberators at the time now come out here for Oliveira that's pretty wild yeah Liberator range as well so Olive air is going to try to break some tank lines but will he have more Vikings he's got 15 to 10 that's a big deal maru's Raven usage is going to have to be very strong if he wants to hold this incoming push okay he scans over here and this is gonna be a hard position to push into our toe says he does gun down the first Viking um we have some great armor shreds going
(1:02:48) down the Vikings going to town on each other but right now Oliveira does have more bringing for those very important liberators we were talking about he's going to force some of these tanks to unsiege and move back yeah between the tanks and the liberators he can start to LeapFrog forward here and try to crack open this position for Marlo we're seeing a lot of Tanks get gunned down our doses we really are the liberator's so great at breaking these positions still he has to keep more Vikings the Viking count very close on both sides
(1:03:18) Maru trying to hold on right now as Oliveira tries to push forward kills another tank with the liberators going after another one as well the tanks continue to come down it seems to be working I think Mario is going to lose his base more Marines come in here and they stem to break in oh he's going to be able to pick that off so quickly and armor strike goes down on his Marines but he continues to fight chasing Maru back one base goes down but Morrow has so many more he's now expanding over into the very far bottom
(1:03:50) right he has six o'clock as we can see over here um where does he try to go Marlo has to try to remake his tanks he has to get some kind of unit composition to address the threats that Oliveira has created Maru only has two tanks right now tastes and only two factories this is a terrible situation he must keep those tanks alive Oliveira continues to push him back controlling the pace of this game he's gonna try to come in again he does gun down some of those Vikings the Vikings trying to pick off the um medevx
(1:04:20) if they can there's a planetary here scds can repair but they need to stay behind yeah this is real you're up there with that many Siege tanks he's going to lose the planetary as well Maru massing up outside of his natural he's lost control of these two bases that's very painful but he's still got a lot of Supply he's got a lot of SUVs he's got a big army he still has a chance in this game Mario's gonna try to come down and engage with this Army that's over here a big pickup he's going to go into the
(1:04:49) main gonna dive on the internet the position Oliveira has oh I love this drop from Oliveira though nothing in here formari does bring up a couple Siege tanks but a lot of his reactors getting picked off and then Oliveira gets off the air the area he's just hurting the production of Maru the SUVs that fled the six o'clock position are now mining over here in the very far bottom right but this base is going to go down as well Oliveira continuing to grow he's actually expanded just one screenshot north of where we were a
(1:05:23) second ago oh my gosh yeah Oliveira getting more bases at this point still controlling the map still shelling down Maru bases I think right now he feels it he's getting closer and closer to being the world champion yeah the command center is getting so low a big push here in the middle of the map Morrow trying to fight back I don't see very Marines to defend I think all might be able to break into this position you might be right about that oh but it looks like Oliveira coming back at the side with his arm he gets a great Army armor shred
(1:05:54) off and here we go disables on all these tanks Maru breaking through he's coming through he's just destroying this position right on top of these star ports another siege tank comes up Mario's gonna have to try to move his tanks in a little bit further but if he missteps Oliveira can dive in and take those all out that's right look at these Vikings of Oliveira he's trying to fight right now and in fact he does have more Vikings the armor strike goes down but I don't know that that will be enough I
(1:06:20) think he's going to win this Air Battle and Maru may have to flee once again yeah I think even with the weekend Vikings you just have too many it's just a game of math right now and without those Vikings uh you know it's very hard to spot for your own tanks not just that as soon as he won the Viking battle four more liberators he's going to use those to push those tanks back but in the meantime Maru rotating his army to the side will kill off another base he tries to come in and dive on that tank but
(1:06:51) there's too many marines he might be able to protect it more tanks coming up right now here for Oliveira oh some great disables go down picks off a couple more seat Shanks as well the liberators come forward but Maru so quick with his unsieged backing up and now he's going to do to Oliveira what Oliveira did to him he can pick off even more bases yeah I mean there's just so much of the map that Oliveira has right now he actually didn't know that base was taken tastes he could have killed that he doesn't even realize how behind
(1:07:19) he is right now oh no bad news for tomorrow yeah he doesn't know about this base over here in the bottom right as well well he's gonna go somewhere let's see if he checks he stims some Marines up he sees the planetary this is certainly something that Mario can attack yeah Oliveira is going to go for a counter-attack here you know when you're ahead uh in bases sometimes the counter attack with everything can be a little bit stronger because the person who's doing the initial attack this has more
(1:07:44) locations they have to try to wipe out yeah that does occur oh a quick pick off right there from Oliveira he's doing a massive counter attack he's going to the most main base he's gonna go in here and kill all the factories and barrackses this is really bad news for Maru as these tanks come up for Olivera he sets up some beautiful liberators as well saying no you can't see Jim Morris walk all the way around but is this breakable he has all the tanks disabled here the Marines are going to come down and fight
(1:08:14) they're all going to get thinned out and now the tanks get destroyed in an insane moment that is perhaps the best break I have ever seen from an invincible position Maru making some magic keeping himself in the game but just barely so now Mario's Supply is way down right now oh Oliveira basically lost his main Army he was really hurting um but again the income is so high he can start to try to remake that but our toes is I'm Blown Away the the skill that Marlo exhibited there I thought that was going to be the neck brain
(1:08:49) movement with those Siege tanks but he paneled it perfectly I don't think anyone else in the world could have lived through that that was the most beautiful positional play I've ever seen But Oliveira uh continues to have an advantage way way more Supply Maru moving up through the map it's hard to even keep track of how many bases they have at this point they are our Command centers going up and going down everywhere as these two just Pummel each other it looks like already Oliveira has managed to remake most of his army the
(1:09:20) tank count is certainly going to be lower though and so we're gonna need to see you know how he tries to handle this for the time being though um it looks like you know Marlo growing into the bottom center he's looking pretty healthy Oliveira actually taken in the very upper left corner I feel like I don't even remember when that base was taken out but now he's got it so yeah he traded spots there's actually been so much action happening on the map yeah a lot of back and forth with these
(1:09:45) expansions the liberators being used for some harassment as well Mario is going to clean that up uh and Maru is really focusing very very heavily on this raven production his Raven spell casting is going to be so key both in defense breaking other locations they went the wrong way and Oliveira instantly jumps on them oh my God they're trying to get back but they can't and so many are picked up Siege mode is up does he have enough medvets covering most of this fight it's hard to say even what's going on here but
(1:10:20) Olivera takes it Olivera is the world champion got to be today give it up for Oliveira he is your Intel extreme Masters whoa [Applause] [Applause] you said this felt like a dream well you are not waking up because I have to tell you something you are the Intel extreme Masters world champion I mean likes

(00:00) hey everyone welcome back sorry for the delay on getting this one out I've been practicing for some tournaments and doing some other stuff but uh let's jump into it so we have today maru's famous 2-1-1 build he was even asked I am kind of weak so why he only plays two one one um which is uh just just a insane comment I'd like to ask somebody but it's really funny anyway um this build is extremely versatile can be used in all matchups um I would say tvt is actually probably not as strong uh that's what we're
(00:37) watching today we're watching Maru versus Beyond TBT maru's two on one opening and uh this was during the Korean Starcraft League hosted by Dave Testa and chicken man I think those are every they're every Friday Korean time Korean Standard Time kst 12 p.m so like 12 in the afternoon Korean time um definitely check those guys out that's where I'm getting a lot of these videos from and that's another tournament I should be playing and starting soon so that will probably we'll probably have
(01:13) my own videos or my own gameplays up here so that should be interesting we can analyze my mistakes and we can start going into what not to do and uh I think that might be kind of fun so 211 opens up very standard you know you get your your first SUV to build the depot into the barracks and then Barracks gas at the same time also notes replays build order all of that is in the comment section below pinned to the top so if you have any questions or need a refresher or want you know more insight or more General
(01:48) Insight definitely check that out I like this little subtle detail too of sending the SUV and maintaining at least 12 workers on the mineral line at all times it's little things like that that you notice that uh professional players do I'm gonna ignore a lot of the uh the chat in this game uh they do talk a lot I did try to translate it but Google translate's not my friend so they got a Reaper coming out we did send out our scouting SUV Reaper orbital second CC he's just gonna go up he's gonna double
(02:29) check he goes all right check that out he's going Factory first so we know he has double gas right now that's pretty easy to know which means he's probably making a couple Reapers he might be making a couple hellions so we'll probably play a little bit more defensive because we won't have as many units this is also the uh the important part too when doing this build you drop the second command center after your um after your orbital and Reaper right and then you drop your Supply Depot at the
(03:02) normal time and that's what you're going to use to gauge when to drop your next barracks as the kind of golden standard I also like this book so you don't have to pull off gas you don't have to do a lot of micromanagement there it's just pretty simple finishes our Barracks is up we're constantly producing SUVs we never stop and we're throwing up a bunker at the front I really like this move um this is really good you can also turn this into a partial wall off which I really like as well
(03:36) um by having it like next to the command center and then using a supply to supply Depots you can make like a really long wall off which makes it hard for it's usually better against like Zerg I would say um or protoss who protosses that favor lozella run buys um that way you don't have to dismantle later you can kind of keep it up until you're ready to disassemble it um another thing this is really good for TBT and TVP specifically uh because if you were in say Terra versus protoss one stalker coming up the ramp and shooting
(04:10) your Marines who are just standing there is really bad uh any two gate pressure early 2K pressure is stifled by the bunker and makes it a little bit easier gives you a nice solid foundation at the front to protect yourself and same goes for versus Taran if they try to run up with hellions you're going to do a significant amount of damage and possibly kill a Hellion or do a lot of damage to him to the point where they don't even attack you so because it's TBT we see beyond going for double or two Reapers
(04:42) and then as soon as he hits that uh the gas requirement he drops his Factory I think it's a hundred gas we're not getting ours there we go there it is then we get our second gas as soon as possible it was a little bit delayed here but that's fine it was like half a second delayed I guess so not the biggest deal honestly and I like what he's doing with these Reapers um if you know the entire opponent went with this two gas um Factory build you know they're gonna have you know two to three hellions they're gonna have
(05:18) three to four Reapers so it's better to just kind of hang out and not push across the map and lose your Reapers you kind of already know how the early game is going to go so it just kind of keeps it simple after our Factory goes down we're dropping the reactor on our Barracks we're turning this into an orbital I will say I think the third cc is a little bit more delayed on this and I think you can hit a pretty strong six minute timing with this build I think you can then just keep on consistent pressure starting from I think five
(05:50) minutes and because it's TBT um we're gonna open up with hellions if it's tbp I recommend a widowmine uh unless they're going for a bunch of add-ups but you can open up with a widowmine instead here our second Barracks as soon as as soon as it finished we started a tech lab we got our reactor on the other Barracks we started stim with our first hundred gas we're actually not dropping our starport yet and that's why we're building hellions so I'd start stem and then start the little mine if you're in TVP and this
(06:25) could this build also leads into a widow mine drop if you want to do that um versus Zurich it leads into good bio pressure it opens up into even like a banshee opening or if you're kind of crazy you can even go for a battle cruiser opening by taking this gas a little bit quicker and then as soon as so we as soon as our stem started we started saving up our gas for our next starboard and then we're starting a reactor on our Factory we're going to swap those guys um also I did kind of forget I I like to
(07:02) do this thing where we do benchmarks so let's go to the three minute Mark and we're just gonna do a quick benchmark and this is how I would compare myself if you're trying to improve compare your own replays like if in a game where you have them in harassed or has been like a really tame early game you haven't lost all units you haven't been cheesed it's really good to compare yourself to the pro replays so um the best way to do that is to check out the mineral line so we see we're
(07:29) pretty much fully saturated we just have one SUV over here building our Factory and then it's fully saturated our second base is turning into an orbital right now we have two Barracks one with the reactor one with the tech lab building on it and our Factory is coming up now as for overall units we have 24 scvs and actually funnily enough so does beyond so 24 SUVs at three minutes it seems to be the the key right there um back to Mars Vision we have two Reapers one Marine obviously this could be different for everyone depending on what
(08:02) you open with like like for instance if it wasn't TBT and you didn't want to go reverse it was TVP you probably have three Marines right now instead of uh three Reapers or two marines and a Reaper and that's that's the Benchmark the benchmarks are also in that notes that I mentioned previously as well in the uh the comment section speak in the comment section if you guys have other replays or Pro plays that you want me to analyze let me know um if there's interesting builds you want to see or anything like that
(08:35) definitely drop a comment point me in the right direction if you have the replay even better but sometimes it's not even necessary if you just tell me what event it was from um event game name who played it and what the build is or even if you have your own build and you want to send me a replay I'm sure we could do work something out that way I'm sure we could set something up sorry so we're back to the point where I went back in time so we have our our Factory starting our reactor and our starport
(09:05) the main reason you're gonna do this is you're not producing out of this Factory you don't need to in TBT we have our one Hellion uh we can go up to two hellions but we're more focused on Marine production at this point so we'd rather use our minerals there and for SUVs so we're going to use our Factory to build this reactor and this reactor is immediately gonna go onto the starboard all part of our sick timing plan that we're setting up so checking the vision for Maru is do we do spot the uh the drop coming in from
(09:40) Beyond good reaction time that's a hard one so what I what I would like to do here if I was in Mario's shoes I would set like two or three Marines here and the rest over here in this kind of back Alcove area since there's a lot of dead space here that's probably where he's gonna drop from he kind of does that here's the Medevac coming in let's see Reaper a couple Marines Helen so pretty pretty easy to hold uh drop and what I really like here is that he doesn't immediately pull all of his
(10:17) workers um he actually is pretty like calm about it he just kind of moves his army to position away from them because if if Beyond's Army went for this worker line we would have gotten a huge collapse and just killed everything to end up not losing anything um we did swap our starport and Factory so we're looking good there and we've ended up the first drop as for saturation we're still continually pumping SUVs Maru is the macro God so it's really good to uh pay attention to his macro in particular
(10:53) all right so we see that Medevac it looked this is this is the beauty of that bunker too he kind of went in saw the bunker and was like um nah and that's that's also what this question mark is like why why is there a bunker there what so here's the cool part so we're approaching five minutes our stem just finished stim's done we have tumor two medevacs popping out we have a bunch of Marines we're starting our first tech or our first sea tank also sorry I forgot to mention you start the uh engineering Bay at about
(11:29) four it's it's factory second gas uh second rag oh sorry Factory oh my God I'm messing this up really in the notes I was looking at the wrong section of the notes so it's uh when your Tech Lab finishes at 100 this is from the three minute mark this is everything we've done uh Tech Lab finishes you start stem and Marine production reaction reactor finishes you start Marine production your next 150 gas you start your star report and a reactor on your factory you swap these two when they're done you
(12:03) grab your third gas up here uh as soon as these are swapped over then you start your engineering Bay and this will kind of finish up for when our second attack hits our plus one uh damage and there we go now we're caught up and I apologize for that that was a little bit messy like I said check the notes the notes are much more detail organized detailed and organized than I am trying to talk about the game because there's a lot to talk about that I think it's better that works there's something that works better in voice
(12:35) form and other things that work better in a written form um so this is kind of more everything that's going on in spur of the moment something that jumps into my head of what I think is good and isn't good um so yeah anyway so right at the five minute Mark we're gonna do our second Benchmark here um we got two Barracks one Tech Lab One reactor stem just finished we got our star Port we have two medevacs that just popped our first siege tank is on the way with our Factory and Tech Lab our eBay is almost done
(13:05) we are almost fully saturated on minerals and our second we're almost or we're pretty much fully saturated on our main um if you go to our units we got 40 SUVs total so your your goal your benchmark you want to be trying to hit like 35 to 40 SUVs by the five minute Mark if you haven't been harassed so as soon as these medevacs pop we pick up all of our Marines all of our Marines and before they pop so we actually sent our Hellion and our Reaper over to kind of check out what our opponent had what units he has and
(13:41) we're going for a big drop meanwhile Beyond looks for a drop doesn't find one runs away for some reason I actually could have done a lot of damage but I think he also noticed as soon as there wasn't anything in here he's like oh no I'm about to be dropped or he's pushing out on the map somewhere so let's let's follow this um this drop and then we're gonna go back in time and check out the production and macro side so we scan first to make sure we're not going to be dropping into any Siege
(14:10) tanks that are sitting in the mineral line or if there are Siege tanks somewhere around here we know not to drop here basically uh we do see a cyclone so that's going to be our first Target we're gonna boost in and try to drop all of our units on that Cyclone to pick it off which because of Beyond's reaction time he does get into a really good position and then this is also insane by Beyond dropping these uh defense matrixes on the medevax is such a cool idea I never see that normally I just see people spam
(14:39) the uh the turrets but we're just trying to get we're just trying to find as much damage as possible we don't want to lose everything that would kind of hurt um but we're mostly just trying to deal as much damage as we can to be on and keep them at home because this is all of our Force right so if he was pushed out across the map hopefully it brings him back um but if he wasn't it turned to a base trade situation and it hits really early it hits at like 5 30 roughly um so usually most timing attacks hit
(15:12) around around the six to seven minute timing uh for a lot of timing attacks that focus on like winning the game essentially off one or two bases or mostly two bases uh one base timings usually hit a little bit quicker for instance I think like a banshee hits at like in tvz a Banshee timing hits at like 5 30 roughly so if our opponent was doing something weird it would have completely killed him and I like this where he keeps just kind of dropping trying to find a little bit more damage and now we have two tanks we're throwing
(15:50) down our next two Barracks we um we did float our star Port after after our first two medevacs popped out we floated oh yeah let's just go back what am I doing go back to while the drop is happening it's a beauty of replays so five minutes the drop goes out of the base so now let's look at the production side in the macro and we are going to speed it up times two River parts we start our Tech Lab we float our star port to build a new reactor and we build our third Barracks the third Barracks goes on this
(16:19) reactor we're continuing siege tank production we're starting our plus one weapons we're getting our fourth gas there we go I thought it was a little bit early so I guess to kind of to kind of summarize or kind of go through quickly floating our starport we we made two medevacs that's all we needed for now so we want more Barracks we want more production um to sustain tanks and medevacs we need more gas so we're gonna get more gas makes sense to me uh plus one's on the way we're gonna want armor eventually
(16:50) after this we're gonna want to expand to our third base behind this as well uh if you actually look at Mario's minerals it's a dead giveaway that's what we're planning to do so we have 355.95 so we're going to want to drop that third command center after our first siege tank drops it's kind of like directions um like you know when you get directions when you're driving and it's easier to use like a landmark like oh okay I know at this McDonald's I turn right it's how
(17:19) my brain works is like okay after my first siege tank drop this or you know after after my tech labs done start stem you know I just use like weird benchmarks and uh and waypoints basically to I find it easier and better than being like oh well I have 76 Supply uh which is so I just think it's so dumb to try to go off Supply past the two minute Mark like past the two or three minute Mark I think Supply doesn't matter at all don't don't be trying to base your build order off of Supply instead focus on timings
(17:55) and the um like the the waypoints like the the guide stones I guess like okay after after my factory drops then what am I looking to do after my starport drops then what I'm look what am I looking to do and that kind of keeps your brain going on that path of like you're just marking things off of a checklist right you're like you're hitting everything and it makes it harder to forget things right um and that's kind of what I do that's why that's why I like the benchmarks that's how I set up my notes I put the
(18:23) build orders still available so you can kind of just see the general outline of things but um yeah thanks for coming to my Ted Talk on how to improve with Starcraft I hope you enjoyed so that drop is going on right now we do see Maru kind of leaving a couple SUVs around he's overpopulating he's late on his Command Center there it is finally he accidentally banked an extra 200 minerals even the god Taryn does it guys don't worry you aren't alone it is it's just a little sloppy play so now that we have our three Barracks
(19:00) up we got two with reactors one with a tech lab we got our our starport we got our Factory we're going up to three bases what do we want more well we're gonna start having a lot of money soon especially with both of our bases fully saturated so we're gonna want to build more Barracks so we can scale our production so we can go harder so our second tank comes out and then boom we're like okay we're gonna we're gonna hold off on building this next tank until we start our next two when these two finish one One's Gonna
(19:32) finish we're gonna have combat Shields up and running we're gonna be good so let's push out um let's go put the pressure on Maru now or on Beyond sorry we have two Siege tanks we know what he we know he has like two Siege tanks and a handful of Marines so we know our armies are about even so what we can do is while we're expanding the safest thing we can possibly do is attack right um uh make expansion then defense I think that's what we're always to say uh shout out to wyra awesome guy
(20:06) but we're we're going to be expanding right so we don't want to be attacked that's the last thing we want uh so we'd rather have the offensive we know Beyond's not out on the map because we just held him at home with our last drop so let's go and contain Beyond so that way we can get up our third base really free and delay his research let's get further ahead basically and then our Plus One will finish at the same time giving us a huge advantage oh but hey look peon's dropping us
(20:38) so this is a little bit unfortunate I did like Mario trying to preemptively stop any drops from happening I think the missile church should have been a little bit earlier he definitely had the money for it I think one missile turret here and then one missile turret here about I'd say after you drop this Command Center and start your next factor or your next uh teachings and that will kind of dissuade a lot of drops but you know what we aren't that far away so it's not a big problem we aren't gonna
(21:06) stim We're not gonna go crazy we're actually just gonna pull our units I I don't know if I agree with canceling the third CC there what I like in this position is I would like to keep that third CC up maybe Beyond or I know maybe not Beyond but lower level players will try to focus it down and spend a lot of time attacking that so I lose less infrastructure like instead he could have stemmed up or I guess he does he his stems not done but it's about to be done but he can stem up here and deny my plus one that would
(21:37) suck that puts us at a pretty bad spot actually um you know he could be he could snipe these reactors of this Tech Lab before I come back so I would rather keep that third CC and let it soak some damage because they're pretty tanky especially with SUVs and uh we pull the troops we set up a siege tank we pull the boys and we just dive on those tanks and kill everything and uh there was a frontal kind of poke with uh Beyond's units his early game units of his Reaper and his hellions this is a really good move IBM
(22:12) unfortunately we have a bunker so we don't have to worry about it I mean he doesn't know that there's only one Marine in there but bunkers are scary man there we go and we're back to we're back to normal if our third I feel like our third CC could have lived there if it was getting lower yeah definitely cancel it but I think it would have just bought us more time and we'd have lost less considering we did end up losing 14 SUVs as a whole if we go to our units tab we're down 10 SUVs entirely but we are
(22:44) up one tank we're up 12 Marines um we're up to medevax he does have two Vikings on us and his widow mine which is kind of interesting but you know our our army supplies looking pretty good uh it can if you compare directly army supply active forces uh nope that's not what I wanted I want control a h we have 10 more army simply have a lot more army supply uh because he has 10 more workers than us so our Army's bigger you know I mean that makes sense we have exactly 10 Marines so uh we did just kill a lot of his units we took
(23:26) relatively minimal Army losses we took economic losses um but yeah it does suck oh let's actually go back because I do want to look at this really quickly too yeah it's definitely definitely sucks at posting that position but you know what we know we have the Army Advantage let's push across the map and then maybe we can get back ahead economically start our third Command Center and push ahead so we do the nice thing about these guys still being live is they're like forward Scouts we do see this this Army from
(23:56) Beyond so we just immediately Siege up and try to pull him back into US you never want to walk into the siege tank fight we load everything into medevax because it's faster than walking there and we'll just keep it on the production baby should start to start up this gas again and try to get our third base up and going but beyond kind of goes into a kill mode uh where he just starts rallying everything across the map uh so he's rolling into the center of the map which I like more and I think he'll
(24:24) readjust it once he gets a forward position but he's basically rallying it to the safest closest position um now the scary thing about doing this is if Beyond does decide to go for a drop like a mass Doom drop three to four medevax because he does have three medevacs available if he does go for that mass Zoom drop it's now a base trade scenario but if it's a base rate scenario check we have plus one done and his is still two minutes away about no sorry it's about a minute and uh a minute and 10 seconds away
(24:59) and look at that there's the there's the drop which means you know what I know you don't have much defending this I'm gonna stem up the ramp and kill anything that's scary so Emily Gump jumps in goes for the Liberator and the siege tank cleans those up pretty easy and then worries about all the ground forces after now if these Vikings were landed I feel like it would be a little bit harder but still they're like basically made of paper so wouldn't have been as bad for tomorrow and then we immediately after we clean
(25:31) up all the SUVs here we want to dive this infrastructure just take it out as fast as possible we pulled our boys we're staying out of the range of the sea Shanks at home we have a Medevac and we're just kind of biting our time a little bit waiting for him to overextend and then every time he overextends we're going to try to move forward and kill stuff so that was a really good trade for us and the base trade scenario we've locked off this natural expansion no no workers are getting out we're on
(26:00) top of the production so we're killing anybody that spawns we have this nice little nice little Hefty Force back here we're flying all of our stuff away like F this I'm out uh we didn't lift our first Command Center unfortunately but you know what can you do but yeah because we're on top of the production and because we have just a way bigger Army like we win the base trade as long as we float one Command Center away and these this stuff we can even use these workers because we have orbitals so we can use these workers in
(26:36) the Marines to do as much damage as possible to Beyond's remaining forces to make the base trade even harder for him but really the build isn't about the base trade right there's a lot of things that turn this game into a base trade but I want to go back and focus on the build order itself and how versatile and good it is you can use it in every single matchup if you're trying to find one solid build to get better at macroing and microwing and playing Taran in general it's probably going to be the
(27:03) two one one it leads to a safer early game it leads to a lot of build diversity in case your opponent goes something weird or in case you want to play a more of a countery play style um it leads into a lot of just different aspects and it makes bio transitions really easy since you're already at two Barracks when you want to go up to three and then that magic number of five and then again at eight when you're on three bases so this is the build I would recommend any new player or anybody trying to ladder or anybody just trying
(27:35) to generally improve this is the build you should have in your your repertoire the one that you should probably have the most practice on as it's just it's just mechanically good mechanically sound uh this and I think the proxy2 racks are probably I would say like this is probably what I'm ending up playing in the tournament so yeah thanks everyone for watching I really hope you enjoyed it um again leave a comment if you have a specific video match replay tournament Etc that you want me to cover uh I'd be
(28:07) happy to do analysis if you have your own replays that you want me to check out and do some partial free coaching I'm happy to do that as well um we'll get something set up in the comments section that you guys can start dumping your replays into and then I'll happily take a look at those um and then lastly yeah stay tuned for my tournament performances um I plan on doing a lot of like weekly Club cups smaller things uh in the meantime until I get better and uh yeah we'll be recording my failures and putting those on this
(28:40) channel so thanks everyone and I hope you have a good night time bye

(28:08) right tying it up one to one our red tear and play with the deadly attack last time around is cure and up here in the top left-hand side of the map our blue taran player from good game gaming living it up he is a dream yeah this map should be super different right from the very start we should see i would be surprised if one player didn't go medevac you know if we didn't see any medevac opening for a bit of a fight at the start we might even see obviously a bit more reaper hellion opening try and get
(28:43) across the map early and put some pressure on you just arrive at such a faster pace and there are positions outside of the main you can see jump hit depots from and so on you know you just get into those positions also oh so easily on this map so we'll be very surprised if we don't see a little bit of pressure from these guys early and obviously they're going to play like that as well and this game i don't mind curious coming again right just make sure you know exactly what's going on super early like i said dream can get
(29:08) away with it it's just again it's curtin corners hopefully this is one of the only corners he cuts because you just can't cut this you know as many as he did last time yes especially when it comes to just making sure you have an idea of what your opponent's going to be up to when you move into the mid game stages now going for the sc or lack of a cv scout not gonna have to worry about like the proxy racks or like a two racks reaper kind of play or anything else like that coming out of cure it's just gonna be
(29:36) that good old 1-1-1 setup so we are seeing mostly mirrored builds which like you were saying i think is going to be more or less par for the course for the moment yeah no absolutely it's uh going to be fun to see where the difference has come from rising a reactor straight away now from cues so that's an earlier reactor than what dream is going for and so kyra's already been a little bit greedy himself one reaper gets that reactor going you can't lose the reaper right that's gonna be a big thing obviously
(30:06) nowadays in tvt it's very rare someone sends their reaper across the map aggressively because it can just go so wrong so quickly you don't know where your opponent's reaper is but yeah while dream will have a faster second reaper cure will then get to the react to get a couple marines out might even go into reacted reapers and if he does that he's going to have a lot of reapers and a lot of hellions very quickly and that could really turn into a lot of pressure yeah especially the early game pressure
(30:27) which well as we know can end games if you are able to take a nice micro advantage there but for now dream can be moving across with his couple of reapers and looks like he will be the first one to really actually do any kind of poking and prodding over here it's gonna be two reapers versus a reaper and a hellion with some good micro over here that heli is gonna be able to get some juicy splash damage shots off picks off one of the reapers a really solid engagement there for cure i like that i also like from dream though
(30:57) he's gone straight to a cyclone it feels like if he was going to play reaper hell he'd be playing from a bit behind it is rough now losing the reapers because what that means is his cyclone's gonna be kind of on its own with enough reapers they will kill that cyclone so that's what i'm worried about now from dream two at a time otherwise i kind of liked it before yeah we had three reapers two hellions i liked it if the reapers were here with a cyclone i think then going cyclone straight away is good now i'm not so
(31:19) sure because the cyclone can lock on and run away but the reapers can chase and get into range and fight so we'll see what exactly kyo decides to do with his extra reapers finishing up if he's ever gonna take a fight we'll be with those five yep we have a next alien popping on four but those last two reapers that you were mentioning the fourth and fifth reapers are heading across the map and then we head straight into that marine production because you're not going to be banking the entire game on just
(31:43) pressuring with heliums and reapers there is a hard transitionary points and you could try and get some damage done but this is definitely not a match up usually made on the hellington reapers is maybe some advantage you can garner it's very very tough to just end the game unless you truly aren't able to just outmicro your opponent isn't going to be able to find one of those opportunities though cyclone taking quite a bit of damage those supply depots do raise in time but it looks like all of the mules the fresh mules on
(32:06) the low ground are gonna be in a bit of danger he doesn't keep them alive with a second cycle and popping though yeah good decisive decision making from dream he says immediately i can't fight this get safe and then immediately says but i should be able to push it back still right like if you get the jump on me i'm in trouble but if i get the jump on you i could be okay and that's really important because if he just hides up the high ground a second or two longer like you were trying to say right you
(32:28) were ready for those mules to die right and i was too because they should have died but dream was so quick to come back down and say no not this time definitely made a big difference you're just going to be seeing our marines off to the side well here's the medevac from curious to talk about keeping up the pressure it's just being pressure all the time right from the reaper helium now with the siege tanki in this medevac gonna look for some early add-on kills and dream is in a lot of trouble and i
(32:49) just love the kind of speed at which cure is playing in this game yeah cyclone's locking onto something didn't quite catch what exactly they ended up killing over there but this c check looks like it is going to end up falling to the cyclones plus the auto turret over there still being able to find the reactors massive losing the medevac though not ideal yeah losing the medevac is this was looking really good for cure but then he lost the medevac and obviously everything else as well and now it just feels a little bit too expensive you're
(33:16) down a couple of workers still actually the army supplies are similar i mean i've got to say just really good defense from dream right again love what he did decisively before he was decisive here again he said right i gotta get rid of this tank auditorium get my cyclones there and it was just getting there so quickly which allowed him to have a lock on available to get onto the medevac too and to clean that up in the end as well well behind all this we are going to see those command centers being added on so
(33:41) third bases are going to be in the cards for both these players as i think you would expect after all the little skirmishes have reduced their army supplies by quite a bit uh and we are going to be getting into just a vastly expanding terran arsenal now it's going to be a lot more about getting those siege tanks in the right positions complementing them it looks like with that bio force esteem starts up for both of these players and just trying to be in the know having that air superiority also going to be a really
(34:09) big factor as i do like we already see a bit of the decision for both these players to start already adding on a handful of those vikings i think i'm gonna dream having a little bit of a look to see what he can do obviously it's so scary he's got three ravens now the counter attack of the reapers will be nice and we'll get some damage done let's see if it dissuades dreaming from doing something across the map because while the army supplies are even that doesn't necessarily matter when the ravens can just offset it
(34:30) completely looks like he'll just go order turreting i mean that's suv's building structures that stim that's going to go down and scps as they run away actually are going to put themselves in turret range yeah that goes stim i wouldn't mind taking the attack lab down the factory if yeah the turrets don't have the hp to do so but that would be nice i mean he actually does the same amount of damage as he took plus he canceled stem big lead for the stream yeah tech club actually still not even starting back up just yet so
(34:55) that is gonna be a really really big delay there's finally the tech left starts back up but that's gotta be at least almost a two minute delay now uh compared to where dreams stem is gonna end up being so fantastic and that really just buys you so much time and space right you can be a little bit greedier knowing that your opponent is just not gonna actually be able to effectively attack into your stim marines with unstim marines yeah it definitely gives you kind of position on the map as well i mean
(35:23) there's a lot to be said obviously about tank lines and so on but if dream wants to you can move around the map a lot more than cue account right now so that will make something of a difference we do see there's alien trying dot and as well the last of the early game units really being used up now we've got a cyclone left over so i mean that's still okay but it's also getting to the point where the cyclones aren't that great either they're a bit more kind of just cannon fodder at the
(35:44) moment is cure still going to try and be the aggressor here which considering no stem i'm surprised about now it just might be the surprise factor but there's enough ravens i hear i believe here to actually just take this fight for dream as well he'll drop all the turrets down so the tanks will be active will dream continue forward into the tanks he'll go a bit further forward he gets rid of one of them so a couple remain and they're not really in range of much apart from maybe that top side gas so this might be okay
(36:07) dream losing a couple of vikings however he's on a worker lead still will lose a bit of gas mining that does have an impact of course in a very gas-heavy matchup but for the most part he's going to stop the initial kind of strength of this attack yeah what's also interesting is we do see some of the reinforcements streaming across the map as our wonderful observer mapu showing us that that siege tank stopping in the center as it almost got misrallied uh redirects and he's gonna try and reinforce this
(36:33) but at the same time dream comes in to try and break the hold finds a quite a few of those units and i don't know that this army gets back home safely so they just try and trade the best they can but even the best they can is not necessarily gonna be the ideal trade there for cure yeah nice from dream to get on that before any reinforcements got there just take advantage of that army because he took a good fight before right it makes sense that he should have been able to get into a good position and he absolutely
(36:57) got himself into a good position of course right so nicely done nicely handled and dream just gonna take that supply that's all his army supply in his favor i believe he has combat shields finished now so that will still be an advantage he holds for a little bit although he's missing the armory for a little bit so no two two although i'm actually not sure if kira has an armory to start two two either right so those are things which are you know pretty good questions because if he had nominee he does have an army it's just
(37:21) not started it could be taking an upgrade lead and that might be something you can work with later but now he isn't it allows jim to get kind of back into it from his mistake and just means that it's one advantage cue it doesn't take that maybe he could have yeah it's gonna be an awkward situation here because cure is still gonna be playing a little bit further from behind it's just that now the stim delay has been turned into an army supply uh you know being a little bit lower and potentially having lost some of those c
(37:48) shanks so being a bit behind on that count losing a lot of the air superiority and the ravens and whatnot as well i think that dream kept yeah he kept a couple of those ravens alive as well as even a cyclone actually being kept alive is really nice but dream looking to be the one to get aggressive this time they both scan each other at the exact same moment and just kind of having a little bit of a sense that yeah some something's got to be happening right here and it's a good thing that they both identify because if either one
(38:15) of these players are catching each other in siege with armies this large things can escalate really really quickly oh absolutely they can a couple tank shots on the high ground there will do well to just keep dream away fourth base is being established on both sides q is just a little later to get over there as he is in a few different ways right now you know upgrades and just a little bit production here and there in general once again dreamers got that lead yeah it's not as substantial as that lead we saw in the first game
(38:41) but it is that little bit of an edge this is the kind of lead which disappears much faster and is absolutely much more kind of playable as cure and you can see with the sensitives going up this game begins to drawn out and as soon as they both get maxed cure just needs to take like one reasonable fight and then he's gonna have about the same banker's dream as well and this is pretty much evened out yeah now there is still that little upgrade lead that you were talking about earlier a dream should have i want to
(39:05) say based on the the little bars it looks like maybe a 20 30 second window or something where you can try and abuse the fact that he is going to have to too his opponent is not quite gonna have those finished up just yet so we'll see if dream can force the engagement he is getting closer and closer to that those upgrades finishing but it looks like the army for cure entirely stims up with just those two medevac to heal him on up but he really believed that there was gonna be a fight right there ends up not happening so
(39:32) needs a little bit of time to heal back up and make sure he doesn't just get you know one shot by the seat shanks now that's really nice actually because i feel like dream if he like panic sieges there then he gets the jump on the fight right and then swinging kill a bunch of tanks right away uh but dream didn't fall for he just walked back instead they both by the way added two small star ports at the exact same time so they both basically at the same time instinctively feel right this is this kind of game now where it's going to
(39:56) slow down a lot we're taking bases since towers are coming up we're not going to you know we're not going to break each other with marine tank this is going to become an air wall they both need to get a viking lead and with a viking lead you get libs and with libya push back tank lines and this is a great start to that for dream getting rid of a few vikings of cure it's just going to make it that much tougher to catch up absolutely and you can just tell who really feels a bit more in charge in
(40:17) this game just based on the fact that dream is the one that is pressuring dream is the one who has been out on the map and really kind of threatening positions for cure this entire time so far and cure is basically just playing the responsive game he's been doing a good job with it especially the sensor towers of course are going to be helping him out he goes through a big sim forward trying to find the army as he saw the censor tower movement of dreams army not gonna be able to find anything but it's it's tough it's scary when you are
(40:46) the one on the defensive over here because you really feel like you're one small mistake away from being cornered out of one of your bases oh absolutely it's um it's always nice just to be on the mappers dream because the opportunity is there and i always like to talk about opportunity in tvt because well hold that thought because if you're on the map the opportunities are right to take fights if you want to oh q's gonna step forward into tank range maybe believe me could have got forward there what's big
(41:10) is he completely resets the air control though so dream loses a lot of his air units that's a big loss we've just been told about how important that is and then cure he's actually gonna continue forward get rid of the last tank and he's building liberators too he knows what he can do right now he knows he can push back siege tank lines and that was a lot for dream to give up on yeah i like being on the map because it gives you the opportunity to kind of see holes in your opponent and jump you know
(41:30) make jumping moves and that kind of felt like dream thought he had one but cure said no not at all actually this time that was a bad call for me that was a bad read cure definitely gonna be happy with those exchanges for the most part oh even finds the medevacs and is gonna have all these marines over here but i mean you're not gonna like here really likes stimming up his entire yeah those marines could do with a little bit more than just a medevac healing they could do with a is it one is it just one or two venomvax there's
(41:58) four medevacs out on the map for him but and they're drained as well oh yeah that is going to make things a little bit tougher he's going to need a little bit of time and there actually is going to be time dream will really appreciate because he is down a bit of army supply right now and kira was out on the map with some of the attacks on the potential on the left-hand side but well since that army still needs some help healing up not really a whole lot it can do right now viking counts obviously become important
(42:23) again cure did build a couple of liberators so you will use these actually just to harass at the moment but he's gone straight back into raven production you can see dream adds on two more star boards so they're both going to keep on doubling down into the sky units here basically and you know these lips might be slightly annoying but nothing else is going on at the same time so there should be a little bit of lost fine time good quick reaction from dreams sword flying in now obviously you just send a viking out to you over there
(42:45) clean that out get your suvs back to mine and away you go yeah one small thing that we haven't really talked about we talked a lot about the infantry upgrades and whatnot but we do see this minor little thing that uh dream was actually going for some more of those ship weapon upgrades i think or the vehicle weapon sorry uh getting the plus two weapons versus just the plus one i don't even think it's starting up for the cure but uh hold that thought as we do have liberators starting to make their way
(43:10) forward and cure really able just bully his way on in just because he has the air superiority or at least had it earlier on with anti-armor missile plus now the reinforcing vikings makes this a little bit more of a contested fight yeah kira has the upgrade lead on the vikings but i kind of liked what we did there his dream right we used the raven abilities on the vikings to try and offset the difference and give him a chance obviously he had to target down the lips first they were a big threat if you don't get rid of the libs and you
(43:35) lose the viking fight you keep getting pushed back and then you're in a lot of trouble so it was kind of cool he did what he needed to to offset the difference but then he had to give up a bit just to be able to be safe and now here we are continuing on as a sensitive incentive goes down vikings on vikings sonify each other a couple of ravens up in the sky and a couple more tanks pressing forward too as these other tanks will siege up and these marines running in from cuba are going to take a whole bunch of damage maureen's going to
(44:00) fight back from dream he's got a good position on the right side he'll get so many of those tanks so quickly but boy there are a lot of tanks over on the left i believe you dropped the last second matrix on the right but he really needed it on the left or more of these backward tanks as cure will not be broken on his position and dream just kind of needs to get up to like enough ravens or some liberals or something to start breaking this down i mean right now he's kind of doing it with the viking count here and
(44:24) just having vision versus cure not scanning yeah it felt like it was redeeming moments at the end of the fight there for dream but the beginning of the fight absolutely cure catching dream a little bit off guard there with a lot of those sea tanks on siege and well vikings really got some good work to do and well especially not only with the viking count ford uh cure being dwindled but now the medevacs actually become also another target we we have absolutely seen quite a few stims over here from cure here comes another one
(44:52) and that is going to be one that he regrets maybe making moving into all of those siege tanks cj i'm not sure that those marines even got a shot off yeah that was good controlling the vikings as well and they just keep on slaying ravens at the moment great efficient fight from dream picks up so many of those important air units pulls his suvs in to immediately start repairing his own that's obviously great to see look at the yeah resources lost his great just shows that dream has been trading well obviously cure holds his position
(45:17) in the center but dream still holds five bases okay cure stretches out to the bottom left for base number six but it's not really that important yet it's not mine yet dream's fine on five and to be fair the position kira has doesn't stop him taking his own top right and he's actually going bottom left himself so he feels like dreams getting into a lot of controlling positions in this game right now and really starting to push the issue a little bit just hanging out with his vikings and really saying
(45:40) hey look you know i'm the guy with maybe a bit more of an opportunity here more matrixes more we'll have to count stop right though yeah canceling top right is going to be a little bit of a tough one i would love if he actually rebuilt that sensor tower he had lost earlier on because i think that top right hand side is going to be a little bit more vulnerable he is looking to try and expand in multiple directions right now but man these vikings picking off yet another one of these ravens the thor gonna be adding in
(46:06) quite a bit of splashing now you no longer want to viking flower your vikings there yeah don't clump those guys up because it ain't gonna be pretty if you do just see obviously we're completely maxed out across the board a little bit of a worker difference means that dream has less workers but more army supply on the map at any given time that's such a minor thing though so much of this more so it comes down to position and the five or six army supply difference right so well technology supply difference but
(46:34) same idea upgrades as well um kind of continue nicely for dream you know he's playing into plus two ship weapons now so he's finally going to be catching up there but he does have the vehicle weapon lead so little differences across the board more ravens pouring out and this tbt just continues to extend across the map and we have a lot of contest in the bottom left very soon because both players fresh six spaces are down there yeah and obviously that shouldn't really last for very long the moment that sensitive goes
(46:59) up from dream and you realize this q is bottom left i imagine some sort of unit squad will move down there to make some plays that's gonna be really funny too because that does then beg the question you only have so many units and you need to position them well against your opponent do you send a large force to the bottom left or do you think it's just really going to only be small little forces or skirmishes and about controlling the center which i want to say but it looks like here is taking total dominant
(47:25) control of the center the stream just goes for i can only describe it as a counter attack because he knew that kira's army was there he just avoids it yeah i don't think dream was expecting cure to be able to launch his attack so quickly dream is just making a beeline for the main base you have to you've got to get rid of the production both players are going for each other's production you know what if you're just going to sit back and do nothing for 20 minutes each well they didn't really do
(47:47) nothing but best thing you can do stop base trading right that's going to make it exciting and fun and it's interesting because i don't think dream was in a position where he needed to make a play like this whenever you do something like this to make the game a lot more volatile it does feel like dream allowed this to happen whereas it really should have been cuba maybe trying to be the one to make it happen because it felt like he wasn't getting as much done you know i i'm definitely with you in a lot
(48:09) of those regards but i look at the unit count right now and i think it's really interesting to think about a base trade in this situation where you have even-ish viking counts but 11 ravens for dream four ravens for cure i'm just imagining the firepower that those ravens can have and just the longevity they can have but look at that missile turned out that missile turret army that is positioned backed up by siege shanks backed up by some suvs ready to repair there's actually a lot of really great
(48:39) foresight there from cure yeah and james army's just locked in he has like two medevacs on the map so he could slowly evacuate but he would be kind of silly just to let that happen you can just see that cure has already got time to start rebuilding the bottom left james going to try and set us up over here but dream hasn't got any other units on the map apparently right like he just has these units in the bottom right whereas q's continue to deal damage dreams kind of done dealing damage so dream's in a bit of trouble
(49:03) and i just don't think moving across the map is obviously the call and i just like i say it makes it so much more volatile than it ever needed to be crazy choices let's see if we can pull this back though i mean it's still not done he just has to slowly work his way forward here and he can push out of this maybe the ravens can obviously take such a good fight that it does start to swing in a dream's favor again yeah maybe i mean the missile turrets are almost all gone and actually oh i actually really like this decision cure
(49:30) just evacuates because he knows the mistletoes are what we're preventing the body from moving forward but can he actually escape out of here safely yeah there's a lot of marines one of the things dream has is the marine advantage at least over here has more marines overall but they're just not with this part of the army ravens obviously hanging now we're gonna get a couple more kills dream definitely having a better few moments now finding extra bases and now he's on the map maybe he could go top side and clean up the army
(49:53) over there he just needs to start protecting some more of his infrastructure i mean it's tough to decide where you want to go what production actually exists right now for dream because i feel like he's been losing so many of his uh per unit producing structures right now it looks like there are still four factories out on the map right now i think that's going to be one of the big things as well as a couple of those barracks and dream is remaking additional barracks but two of these factors are going to be
(50:17) going down those units coming out of there are not going to be very useful a lot of dreams production is even also in the air he's getting supply blocked as well this is going to make things to be a very awkward situation but finding a lot of high value target units over there even getting the thor is going to be very nice for dream as this game sells down though dream has so much money right he's got 3k 2k and he's already rebuilt a bunch of production he's got a lot more orbitals left alive as well i
(50:40) believe it's hard to keep track of everything he has seven orbitals against one supply depot there's no orbitals in fact from cure he has no scans oh my god that is gonna be a major problem uh most of the buildings in the bottom left must be supplied now now cures got the opposite effect right he had dreams stuck in the bottom right but cures got a whole bunch took in the top left this was an attempted planetary that gets denied i believe the base down from here is still mining in the on the far right side from cuba is
(51:09) that baselining yeah a little bit so obviously a couple tanks there will start to stop that you can't really run into the planetary though i think it's still better mining for dream though and dream has the superior army that's all together and isn't trapped inside your opponent's old main base the vikings are running over the missile turrets as well trying to look for a fight over here they're trying to gun down as many of these buildings as possible gonna be able to find an orbital but that's what
(51:33) one of seven yeah it's not a huge deal and now we're actually going to see if i can sing on vikings obviously big fight right now interference matrix's anti-almond missile oh cue it just has so much supply stuck in that top left and there really is no way out unless he gets medevaced but how is he going to get medevacs right now cures up by about six vikings but he's got zero ravens and the efficiency of ten ravens should just win this unless it all happens too quickly for the ravens to get energy back
(51:57) stims continue to go down i almost wonder if interference matrix would make sense in this situation on the vikings as well as that anti-armor missile just to add in a bit of extra dps those auto turrets also may be able to play an impact but uh you have to get so close he's trying gonna try and go for it throws out a couple of auto turrets the vikings starting to micro a little bit further back they take care of a lot of those ravens but the marines able to join forces with those vikings is dreams starting to break on through
(52:23) are those siege tanks gonna be the hard-line wall and says no you can't move any further forward kira still has 12 vikings yeah he's gonna get rid of another couple tanks one spawned one was sieged we're gonna see the attempted breakout over here so these tanks will try and hold the line these marines are such low hp but they will get enough done to break out secure gets more units on the map on the bottom side the viking count is huge from cure and he's continuing to pick up ravens now we need
(52:46) to get rid of the planetary so the marines can be a little bit more effective over here here is mass preparing he's got more money in the bank right now we've got to scan down the left-hand side to make sure we've got vision and right now that is going in the way of cure though he's just picking off tanks over here cure is going to find dream on siege testifies have to pull in but more goes down and that's the value of freeing up those units in the top left corner it's chaos across the map as we step forward and we
(53:08) get a bunch of vikings too absolutely massive both these players starting to lose their unit breaching structures starting to lose some of their few very few remaining mining bases at this point seven vikings still remain on the map here for cure but the season counts have heavily dwindled the marine count down to just eight now for cure versus the 33 of dream but dream needs to be able to find a way to use these marines he's basically now up against a hard wall where he has only one place left to go and that's into a
(53:38) line of siege tanks there's no way these marines can do that by themselves yeah but he's gonna i think he's gonna deny the bottom side and then he's just gonna be able to mine more and he's gonna have more tanks producing he's got three coming in at a time and cure knows he's got to go right now tournament life on the line he tries to burst on through but his tanks are gone target five from dream is perfect the suv is trying to help but it ain't enough and dream is going to go to the playoffs of canada
(53:59) pizza as he pushes through cuba has nothing left one planet everyone first but that will die to the tanks and dream is gonna do it break the losing streak take down cuba go to the round of 12. g g dream take
